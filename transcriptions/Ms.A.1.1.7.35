WLG to Alfred H. Love; Roxbury. Gives his views on the way to attain
world peace. Thinks that the cause of peace has made progress. “I am not
for the peace that is at war with common sense; that does not strike
back simply through indolence or timidity ...” Cannot attend the
anniversary of the Universal Peace Society.

“I am glad to receive your kind and suggestive epistle before leaving on
my European trip. To its sentiments of ‘peace and good will’ I respond
with all my heart. That cause is dearer to me than the ruddy drops that
run in my veins; and you may be assured that, while I remain abroad, I
shall be happy to avail myself of every opportunity, whether in public
or in private, to give it my support. Not that there can be peace before
there is purity; not that there can be peace before there is the
possession of impartial liberty and equal rights, so far as the masses
are concerned; nevertheless, we must preach purity, and liberty, and
peace, and human brotherhood, and world-wide philanthropy, ‘whether men
will hear, or whether they will forbear.’ We must more and more look
into the causes of war, and do all that in us lies to remove them; or
our abstract peace testimonies will amount to little or nothing. ‘Where
there is no fuel, the fire goeth out.’ The millenial epoch is yet very
remote; for the materials for warlike explosions abound in every land,
and only need occasion for instant and terrible ignition. But the cause
of peace is advancing, and must continue to advance, with the
enlightenment and freedom of the human race; and though we may
occasionally hear of wars and rumors of war, the world is more pacific
in understanding and purpose than ever before. Let us not expect too
much, that we be not discouraged. Let us take care to elucidate our
principles so as not to be unnecessarily misapprehended. I am not for
the peace that is at war with common sense; that does not strike back
simply through indolence or timidity; that counsels a truckling policy
rather than have any excitement; that does not always take side with the
oppressed against their oppressors, though the weapons they use are the
same; and that is mainly characterised by cant and imbecility. The peace
of the Cross is positive, courageous, discriminating, divine. It carries
with it the elements of justice, equality, liberty and love; and whoever
is destitute of these is not qualified to be a peace reformer. [p] I
trust the approaching anniversary of the Universal Peace Society at New
York will be both highly interesting, and serviceable to the blessed
cause it will be held to promote. Of course, it will not be in my power
to attend it, except in spirit, as I shall then be on my trans-Atlantic
voyage.”
