WLG to EPN; Paris. Gives his itinerary. “I believe it is the intention
of some in London to proffer me a public breakfast, John Bright to
preside on the occasion ...” Heard that Paris “has been largely
recreated within the last twelve years by the Emperor Napoleon ...”

“... notwithstanding my long silence, I trust you need no written word
from me to give you the assurance that, of all the tried and honored
friends on this side of the Atlantic who have been co-workers with me in
the Anti-Slavery cause, there is none I more highly esteem, none I am
more eager to see, none to whom I have been more strongly attached ever
since I knew you, than yourself. ... It is now twenty-seven years since
our personal acquaintance was formed in London, and twenty-one since we
parted – a very considerable portion of our earthly life, sufficient to
make marked changes in our features and general appearance. ... My visit
to Paris will be an era in my life. It is undoubtedly the most ‘gay and
festive’ city in the world. I am told that it has been largely recreated
within the last twelve years by the Emperor Napoleon, whose constructive
talent appears to be equal to the destructive one of his great uncle,
Napoleon I. I have given three weeks assiduously to sight-seeing, and
have had my organ of wonder in constant activity. In almost everything,
Paris is the antipodes of London, each being pre-eminent in its way. As
to the grand International Exposition, I have no language to express the
brilliancy and extent of its industrial display.”

Refers to a rift between Mary Estlin and George Thompson, and defends
Thompson from her criticisms.

“No person better knows the infirmities of G.T. than I do; and he has
never found me backward in giving both expostulation and advice. Yet I
know how to make a wide margin of allowance for him, without
compromising any principle, or lowering the standard of personal
character. He has a very susceptible temperament which carries his
spirit to starry heights or sinks it to abysmal depths; in moral heroism
he is a giant, in self-reliance a child; he craves and needs the
sympathies of his friends, and deserves them too, for many reasons; he
is, and in his utter selfishness [sic] is always likely to be, poor in
this world’s goods, and as age is advancing upon him he is liable to
fits of depression, not knowing what he had better do, and unwilling to
trouble even those in whom he most confides with any of his concerns.
Unfitted for business, his thoughts are continually in the interests of
mankind; and though not born for a leader, he was born to labor in the
broad field of humanity and reform, where he would get but inadequate
remuneration, and, consequently, need occasional pecuniary assistance. I
know that there is a prevalent idea in England that he is improvident –
in other words, that he is ‘regardless of money,’ as you say. But I
think that injustice is done him in this particular. ...
