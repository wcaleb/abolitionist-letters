WLG to WLG Jr.; Paris. Received a card photograph from Giuseppe Mazzini,
who may be planning to join Garibaldi. Reports on his brief time in
London after returning from Scotland ...

“Mazzini sent me his card photograph, with a cordial note, intimating
that we might not meet again on earth, unless we met in Italy. So I am
inclined to think he intends joining Garibaldi soon, and may put his
life in peril for the sake of his beloved Italy. Madam Venturi having
sent me four volumes of his writings, (she is a daughter of my old
friend Ashurst,) I reciprocated the favor with thanks, and by sending
her a framed likeness of myself. ... She is his translator.”
