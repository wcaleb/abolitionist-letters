Gibbons, James Sloan, to the Abolitionists of Great Britain. [NY] The
AASS is sending JAC to England to raise money.

[Thanks British abolitionists for all they have done; expresses sympathy
in their current efforts to Christianize Africa, alleviate the
misgovernment of India, etc., and is thankful for their encouragement
and example to abolitionists on the other side of the Atlantic. Asks for
aid. Explains circumstances for the request ...]

“ ... The struggle in this country is in many respects very different
from that which our transatlantic ~~brethren~~ coadjutors had to
maintain, against British West India Slavery. They had not the giant sin
to contend with on their own soil; their natural humanity was not
corrupted by its presence, they had (with some individual and local
exceptions) to pass through no fiery ordeal, to incur no personal or
pecuniary hazard, to combat no complexional prejudice, to wrestle not
‘against principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high
places.’ With us Slavery is omnipotent. Wide as is our national
territory, its fierce spirit covers the whole surface thereof, and there
is not one foot of earth in all the country, on which a fugitive slave
can stand in safety, from his pursuers. ... [Discusses the Schism.
Refutes charges against AASS, focusing on inclusion of women.]
