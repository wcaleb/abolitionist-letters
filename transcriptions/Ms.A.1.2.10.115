JAC to Clarkson. Copy.

{Perhaps addressed to Mary Clarkson. Thanking Clarkson for their recent
visit to Playford Hall. Explaining their public censure, [in the Express
of this morning?] of Mr. Alexander for his opposition to their mission,
which they made not out of personal hostility to Alexander, but out of
convictions of duty and a desire to somehow reach the people of
Ipswich.}
