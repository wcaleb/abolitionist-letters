Alexander, Richard Dykes, to JAC. Re: his inability to sympathize with
JAC’s mission.

“It is with pain that I cannot sympathise, my friend, with thy mission
in any way and I think it more frank to tell thee so rather than to take
refuge in any excuse. [p] It would, I believe by an act of unkindness to
the dear man [Clarkson?] thou no doubt venerate to pay him a visit at
the present time when from being overworking he is unable to take up any
fresh subject – I trust thou wilt not pursue thy project of going to
[Playford?] Hall. [p] I feel much in thus writing to one on a
philanthropic errand from a distant land but I am so thoroughly
convinced that thy mission will not succeed in this place that I cannot
in any encourage thee to proceed.”

[Copy of JAC and CLR’s reply to another later note of Alexander’s on the
next page:] In reply would say that they are very grateful for his
unsolicited interference in forestalling the mind of the venerable
Clarkson & preventing an interview with him on the subject of their
mission: -- and if they rightly understand the terms of R.D.A’s
invitation they must decline taking coffee this P.M. at 5’o’clock &
shall feel themselves called to bring the object of their mission before
the inhabitants of Ipswich through another sourse. [sic]”
