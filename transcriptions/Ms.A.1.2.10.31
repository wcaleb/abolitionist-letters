Kimber, Abby, to RDW; [Kimberton]. Discusses W.I. Emancipation as
“differently situated” from U.S.

“If all have felt as I have, since I left your hospitable shores, I fear
you have been overwhelmed with letters, from us straggling Yankees; not
that I would have you infer, that I have been restrained by any
consideration of this kind, for it opportunity had favored me, as often
as, I have felt inclined to chat with you, I am sure, you would have
thought me, ‘instant in season and out of season,’ – but so busy have we
been, [lionizing?] among our ‘Hicksite friends,’ telling them how
Lucretia, ‘{u}could do{/u} no mighty works among you because of your
unbelief,’ then among our Orthodox friends, telling them how cowardly
they wrote, setting friends in Eng. on their guard against Lucretia ...
Then all these, and more also, having to impart to our Abolition
‘brothers & sisters’; who would also incline to hear of the Grand
Convention, of Clarkson of Sturge of Buxton, always ending, if not
beginning, with earnest questionings of O’Connell. Then last but not
least there were our romantic young folk delighted to hear of [Lock
Lommand Lock Katrine & Melrose Abbey?] – or the gay, eager to hear of
Paris and its wonders – so you may readily see, that thus while telling
of ‘all we felt and all we saw,’ we have scarcely yet realised that the
flurry is actually over, and that the broad ocean is indeed rolling
between us, and some friends, who made us forget for a time, that such a
barrier existed between their shores and ours. ... [p] When I read the
papers, which you are so kind as to send me – it is so pleasant to see,
one of you talking of ‘our convention,’ {u}another{/u} at a temperance
meeting – that I look round almost expecting to see you at my elbow –
ready to make remarks on what I have been reading – I could {u}see
thee{/u}, Richard, drawing Lucretia’s {u}portrait{/u} – and I could see
Hannah too remarking on it – laughing at the thought of any body being
plainer than she. ... [Discusses how many Orthodox friends are still
reluctant to be abolitionists. Mentions Joseph John, who keeps clear of
abos but still wrote] a book on ‘West India Emancipation’ a very popular
subject, one which many slave holders, and many northern apologists for
them will admit to be a very good measure for the W. Indies – but one
that can {u}never{/u} be imitated here, because {u}we are differently
situated!{/u} No man would commit himself by writing on that subject – I
mean commit himself as an abolitionist. ... [last page:] I had rather
have missed Switzerland than Dublin, for we may not write or receive
letters from Mountains or Glaciers – and there they may stand like the
Mountains of Wales, until we come again.”
