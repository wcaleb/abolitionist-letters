Burleigh, C.C. to the Abolitionists of Great Britain. [New York]
Discusses JAC’s mission to England to raise money. Basically a broad
letter of introduction. Burleigh is the Secretary of Foreign
Correspondence for the AASS at this time.

“Brethren, we need not tell you that in prosecuting our enterprise for
the deliverance of the American Slave, we are engaged in an arduous
struggle. You know by what you have accomplished, & by the cost of
effort, sacrifice & self-denial at which your glorious triumph was
achieved, that a system fortified by interest real or supposed, by deep
seated prejudice & love of power; sanctioned by a corrupt Church,
defended by a clergy recreant to their duty as Teachers of the Gospel of
Liberty; & sustained by the subserviency of political parties false to
their own professed principles; cannot be overthrown without strenuous &
persevering exertions. [p] For reasons which will readily occur to you
without their being mentioned here, our undertaking – in order to
succeed – must surmount still greater difficulties than ever lay in your
path to victory.”

[On the next page, a letter to James S. Gibbons privately expressing
that his “heart was not in” this letter, and that he heartily
disapproves of Collins’ mission personally. But he consents to send his
name only as a ministerial act.] “I do not wish my name to be placed
where it is liable to convey the impression to {u}any body{/u} that I
think well of this mission to England.”
