Collins, J.A. {u}An Appeal to the Abolitionists of Great Britain for the
American Anti-Slavery Society{/u}. Printed circular. Elizabeth Pease’s
copy. Good illustration? {Brief history of the AASS; Argues that its
influence has been great, since anti-slavery sentiment is now
widespread. Explains its pecuniary difficulties, and calls on the
“enlightened philanthropists” of Great Britain for immediate aid.
Reasons for pecuniary difficulties include: the Panic; the political
election, which diverts attention and funds, as well as led to the
defection of some abolitionists. “It is confidently hoped that, when
this political simoom shall have blown over, those formerly friendly to
our cause will again return to their senses, strike hands with the
friends of freedom, and the Anti-slavery movement once more command the
sympathies and interests of the great and good. Then it will be enabled
to prosecute, with renewed energy and success, its warfare against the
soul-destroying system of Slavery, till public sentiment shall become so
reformed by the pure principles of Christian love and freedom, that
Republican and Christian America, following the example of Great
Britain, shall drive Slavery from her realms, and pledge her moral and
political influence for the entire extinction of Slavery and the Slave
Trade from the face of the whole earth.”} ...

“The Abolitionists of the United States are emboldened to make this
appeal to the friends of freedom in Great Britain; 1st, because the dark
spirit of Colonial Slavery, against which they fought so nobly and
fiercely, has been laid in the dust; 2nd, from the general interest
manifested to abolish the Slave Trade; and 3rd, from more recent
expressions, made by her delegates at the World’s Convention, never to
cease hostilities until Slavery and the Slave Trade shall be abolished
throughout the world. The spirit of sacrifice, zeal, energy, and
devotion of the Abolitionists of the United States has been unequalled
by any body of men since the days of primitive Christianity. Could they
possibly have sustained the cause through this most trying crisis, this
appeal would not have been made. If the philanthropists here will aid to
hasten the abolition of American Slavery – when this desirable object is
accomplished, which cannot be far distant – then the moral and political
influence of the two most enlightened and Christian nations of the globe
will harmoniously and successfully co-operate to exterminate Slavery and
the Slave Trade from the face of the whole earth, and to establish in
its place the peaceful gospel of the blessed God.”

{Signed John A. Collins and Charles Lenox Remond.}

{Postscript by James S. Gibbons, Chairman of the Ex Comm:} “Under these
circumstances, we are constrained to make this appeal to our British
brethren, trusting it will not be made in vain. If we can be sustained
in our operations some three or four months longer, the crisis will
undoubtedly have passed, and the Society will be able successfully to
stem the tide of opposition, which now threatens to swallow it up. The
Anti-slavery cause is a common one, and pecuniary aid and moral support
may be properly obtained for it from any quarter of the globe. If the
present effort to abolish Slavery in this country be allowed to
terminate for want of means, our destiny as a people is sealed. In its
success, the whole world is deeply interested, and especially England,
whose prosperity as a nation will be vastly increased by the extinction
of that destructive system, which is crippling {u}her{/u} commerce and
manufactures, as well as our own.”
