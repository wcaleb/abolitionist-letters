Pugh, Sarah, to EPN. Philadelphia. Talks about the voyage home with
Lucretia Mott and Abby Kimber. Praises L.M. and criticises her enemies.

“Surrounded with the dear delights of home & home friends, the scenes of
the few past months are almost ever present to me. How much of stirring
interest did they afford as they passed along & how much food have they
furnished for thought in coming years; humanity under aspects so new yet
in all bearing evidence to our common nature: -- its greatness & its
littleness, its grandeur and its meanness. ... [A few limericks about
Birney, Scoble, and Sturge, by Abby Kimber?:]

“Joseph S. Joseph S.

By that look of distress,

You know that a Storm’s brooding now,

But anon thy bland smile

Shows all’s right for awhile

The ‘Convention Barometer’ thou

Joseph Sturge!

The ‘Convention Barometer’ thou.”

{Calls the {u}Christian Examiner{/u} “one of our periodicals.”}
