Grimké, Sarah, to EPN. Re: WASC. Regrets that the “women’s question” was
introduced.

“The Worlds Convention must indeed have been fraught with the deepest
interest, it was an august spectacle to see men & women brought from
various parts of Christendom assembled to consult on the best means of
opening the prison doors & setting the captives free, of stigmatizing,
with infamy the crime of holding men in bondage, & bringing down the
rational creatures whom Jehovah formed in his own image to the level of
the beasts that perish – Had it been duty for me to be there I should
have esteemed it a great privilege, but as it was not I rejoiced that my
lot was cast for the present in privacy & quietness – It seemed to me at
first view that it was cause of regret that the woman question as it is
called was introduced, as it has I fear carried with it some of those
unchristian feelings which characterize the controversy in this country,
but I forbear to judge it may induce an examination of this subject
which may be a blessing to the women of G.B. certain it is that we are
under bondage to man & that our rights & privileges as human beings are
little understood, & less appreciated, by our own, as well as the other
sex – I apprehended injury to the cause of the slave, the cause which
called the Convention together, but it may be the means of extending the
usefulness of woman in that very cause – One thing is very clear I
think, viz. that the Convention had no right to reject the female
delegates; as members of A.S.S. they were entitled to a seat unless it
could be proved that they were not persons – the 2d call issued by the
Committee to the contrary notwithstanding.”
