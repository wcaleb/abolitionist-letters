**[1840, 11-27] Ms.A.1.2.10.59**

CLR to EPN. [London] Has been disappointed in the results of his and
JAC’s mission. Tells of an interview with Buxton, who was engrossed in
“the Civilization enterprise,” and said that “America must now fight her
own Battles ...”

“We had a brief interview with Sir T.F. Buxton. He received us very
kindly, but the moment friend Collins touched the cord of finance a
shrinking was perceptable [sic], and he remarked that in consequence of
the numerous calls the past year he had almost exhausted himself in
time, talents & purse and in addition to this he had in hand the
Civilization enterprise which for the present engrossed his every
resource and further, that he was not alone in the conclusion that
America must now fight her own Battles, and for these & many other
considerations I was almost of the same opinion for a moment – but the
next, the thought of my countrymen & women in chains moved me to the
conflict again & perceiving that from the [press?] of Mr Buxton’s
engagements our conference would be of short duration, every time when
frd Collins would stop to draw a long breath, I would begin & thus we
monopolised the [restive?] time, which was hardly fair play to use a
[?], however we flattered ourselves finally that we succeeded in
touching a tender string & friend Buxton promising to read any document
Mr C. would put into his hands and meeting with Mr Foster at this time
who politely invited us to dine with him tomorrow, we bid good morning
(and as my little sister used to say) went on our way rejoicing to think
we fared no worse if we should be favored as we hope to be, with another
interview and succeed in making it plain to the mind of Mr B. that the
society which now asks aid of British philanthropists is the one upon
whom the hopes of the bleeding captive in our guilty country centre ...

Who are the free! The sons of God

That hate oppression, strife and blood,

Who are the slaves! The men that sell

God’s image for the gains of Hell,

They scourge the frame, the sinews bind

They trample on the immortal mind

Earth can endure the guilt no more

And God rolls on the avenging hour,

Proclaim the truth, speed forth the laws

Strike at the sin his soul abhors

Break every yoke, the slaves release

Let chains and stripes and bondage cease

Then shall the world resemble heaven

Oppression back to Hell be driven

And love shall bind in sweet accord

All nations ransomed of the Lord.”
