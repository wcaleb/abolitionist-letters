Gray, John Edward, to JAC; British Museum. Refuses to help the AASS.
Considers that Slavery in America concerns only the Americans.

“Sir, I regret that the American Antislavery Society should be in the
embarrassed circumstances you state in your note but I think this is a
matter which only concerns the Americans and if the friend of the Negro
in that country cannot do without subscriptions I should consider their
advocacy as of little importance as I dislike bribery in morals as much
as I do in Politicks and again there are evils enough about our doors to
remove which it is our business to try our best to aleviate [sic].”
