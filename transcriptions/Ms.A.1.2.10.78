Hill, Martha, to JAC. 23 Great King St, Edinburgh. Discusses the way
people give to help those in distress. Didn’t think J.E. Gray would
disapprove of contributing to American emancipation. Thinks that West
Indian emancipation should have some influence on American thought
concerning slavery.

“My dear Sir, I received your letter this morning and hasten to enclose
you the other half of the note. I grieve for the facts you mention but
the want of deep & general interest in the great causes of humanity is
not confined to that which may be termed ‘foreign.’ I [meet? met?] with
[amiable?] & benevolent men who would assist a poor man or a poor
criminal {u}were he brought before them{/u} with the utmost zeal &
humanity; but endeavour to obtain their assistance in those [with
means?] that should prevent an honest man requiring charity or a
criminal from falling into vice from want & they appear literally
immovable. It is not want of benevolence but want of a [?] or
[realizing] certain ideas. I truly believe that some of them who you may
have found most apathetic would suffer much to serve a slave were he to
appeal to them in distress. [p] I am very sorry to tell you that one of
the introductions I gave you will I fear prove useless. I had so long
known the indefatigable benevolence of my friend Mr. Gray in personal
exertions for the welfare of the [leper?] that although I knew his ideas
generally upon frittering one [?] on distant objects I did not think he
would apply this feeling to American emancipation. He was the first to
show me “the Martyr Age of America” & to express his admiration &
sympathy with that dauntless band of men & women. In a note however that
I received from Mrs Gray this morning she tells me that while it gives
him real pain to refuse [one? any? you?], he does not think it right to
direct any part of the income he devotes to their objects of benevolence
that he can really superintend to distant objects – moreover that he has
the idea that infinitely more good is done by individuals than by
societies!! Now although this surprises me, it cannot alter my opinion
of my excellent friends uniform benevolence – I know he will keep true
to his principles & that it would give him so much pain to refuse
assistance to the society that I can only beg you not to call. ... A
friend of yours has lent me some American papers. I very much grieve
that it should be thought necessary to speak against so many who call
themselves the friends of the cause. Must not you often cut off the
possibility of their joining you by that means. I know however we can
scarcely judge of this matter in England. ... Pray be not cast down.
Infinitely more has been [done?] the last ten years than for the hundred
preceding. The fact of the good conduct of the negroes & the economy of
free labour in the West Indies must daily act on the minds of Americans
to a degree that cannot be calculated. I think you should return home by
way of Canada & there by the sight of the human happiness that the
Abolitionists have created refresh alike your spirits & your hopes.
