Gairdner, Harriet, to JAC. “I feel you will carry away but an
unfavorable impression of our country ...” The English were very proud
of the WASC. The manufacturing districts of Yorkshire & Lancashire are
not guided in their opinions by London. Mentions the “greater
hopefulness” with which America looks to the future.

“I fear you will carry away but an unfavorable impression of our country
across the Atlantic for certainly you have not found the right way to
the heart of our people. I suppose the reason may be that the English
were mighty proud of their Convention the ‘World’s Convention’ & are
affronted that you ... [ellipsis illegible] have [dared?] to speak so
[?] of its deliberations & even, worse still to refuse the proffered
honour of seats in its ranks. But tho’ you have not met with much
encouragement in London, the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire &
Lancashire are not by any means guided by [the?] opinions of the
metropolis, their interests are different & in many things they are in
advance. Witness the interest they are now taking in the East India
question when London wont give it a hearing. As far as I remember the
large provincial towns took much more the lead in petitioning &
agitating for the West India Abolition also, than the capital [?] [?]
[?] it cannot be united to any good purpose. ... It is not one of the
least advantages America has [that as?] the greatest hopefulness with
which you can look forward to futurity. You are not weighed down by the
multiplied corruption of past ages of [?] so the way is clear before you
whereas we are surrounded with impediments which must be overthrown
before we can make any real progress. [?] is our [?] Church
Establishment – our Aristocracy our barbarous statute book with it –
[Game?] laws Corn laws &c. & then when one thinks of the gross ignorance
in which the masses of the people have been kept [?] cannot but fear
that when the struggle does come it will be [heady?]. Were the people as
a mass educated it would be far [?] but of this there is no immediate
prospect & till then an appeal to [force] is [?] to be dreaded in which
as the experience of past revolutions has taught us, it is not always
the right that is victorious.”
