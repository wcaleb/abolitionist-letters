**[1840, 12-10] Ms.A.1.2.10.87**

EPN to JAC; [Darlington]. Encloses letters to Mary [daughter?] and
Thomas Clarkson for JAC to read. Expects the BFASS to refuse aid. Anne
Knight may give him some money, and T. Clarkson may give him a note of
approval. Clarkson very feeble and next week unsuitable – he is
“tottering on the brink of the grave & cannot hear long visits.”
