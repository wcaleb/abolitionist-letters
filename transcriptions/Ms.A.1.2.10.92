Clarkson, Catherine, to JAC. Regrets that T. Clarkson is too busy to see
JAC. TC recommended that JAC “should communicate with Joseph Sturge or
the Committee of the BFASS ...”

“A letter was received here yesterday from Miss E. Pease of Darlington,
giving an account of your arrival in England & of the object of your
visit, specifying also your wish to see Mr. Clarkson & to consult with
him as to the best means of fulfilling your mission. ... [Unfortunately,
Clarkson so busy that ] I have not thought fit to lay Miss Pease’s
letter before him. It has however been shown to his most intimate
abolition friend, at Ipswich who strongly recommends that you should
communicate with Mr. Joseph Sturge or the Committee of the British &
Foreign Anti Slavery Society in New Broad Street who can do more to
forward your views than any private individual. [Hopes that Clarkson
will soon be free enough to meet with him personally.]”
