JAC to BFASS. {Addresses the BFASS’s rejection of JAC’s request for
money. Possibly a rough draft or a copy.}

“Permit me to remark, gentlemen, that the committee of the B &
F.A.Slavery Society, declared in their annual report of June 1840, that
‘wherever there is a human being subject to slavery or the victim of the
slave trade, thither should their eyes be turned, their sympathies
directed and their help afforded.’ This declaration, I have understood,
as holding out the offer of cooperation and assistance to those who
labor for the abolition of slavery in every part of the globe. I was
therefore surprised when I read in your letter, that you are not
‘entitled’ to give the American anti Slavery Society, (if the state of
your funds would permit,) that aid which its situation and circumstances
require. I shall therefore be obliged to the committee to explain their
meaning when they say ‘that whatever the amount of their funds may be
they do not consider themselves {u}entitled{/u} to dispose of them in
the way you desire,’ which desire was, that you would assist the
American anti Slavery Society, by a money grant, to carry on the work of
emancipation in the United States. ... It must be, gentlemen, the
earnest desire of every sincere and upright minded man, or of every
associated body of men or men and women laboring for the overthrow of
slavery, to gain the countenance & good wishes of all others working in
the same cause of righteousness, whoever they may be or wherever
situated. You may therefore conclude that the American Anti Slavery
Society will be somewhat confused and anxious to ascertain what its
‘course recently pursued’ has been, to ‘alienate’ your ‘confidence,’ to
that degree as to refuse to wish it God speed.”
