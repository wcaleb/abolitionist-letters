NPR to RDW; Concord. Their friendship one of his most valued. Domestic
news. His dislike of England, love of Ireland. Hopes for Ireland’s
renovation through moral influence, and freedom from England. Quite
illegible.

[Wishes Webb could be in New England, but doesn’t want him to encounter
the vituperation they suffer.] No my dear friend stay in Ireland &
reform her. Ireland needs you & deserves you. Ireland is {u}Homeland{/u}
to you. It would make you heartsick to be exiled from her sweet coast.
... If you could come & visit us next summer you would greatly enjoy it
– but to come & live I fear you would be disappointed. I am inclined to
think too that God has claims on us in the lot where he casts our birth
– though I think if I had been born in England, I should like to
emigrate. England is a horrible country to my fancy, a cold blooded,
cruel, tyrant country. Oh what a history she has – What a continuation
of combat & executions! Her green fields seem to me verdant with
manuring blood. Her gorgeous oaks to have shot up out of the fertilizing
& nutritious influences of human slaughter – civil war has fattened all
her woodlands, moistened all her slopes & ridges. I felt sickened when I
looked at them. She is a tyrant & the grand enemy of Christianity among
the nations & God will bring her pride even with the ground. Her ‘proud
pavillions [sic]’ will become ‘the hermit’s house’. Ireland I love. She
seems an injured, oppressed isle. I pity & love her & I glory to see her
clothing herself with sobriety as with a garment. It will finally bring
her deliverance. If O’Connell would only abjure his politics & turn
moral agitator – he might be gloriously useful just now. Instead of
repeal let him advocate teetotalism, industry, Christianity, and to do
away the appearances of all mercenary motives let him dispense hereafter
with the Irish contributions. Let him forgot it & go without all the
splendors & luxuries of life, dwell humbly, & go about using his mighty
powers for the good of his country, her moral good, not political. Let
Irish men have Christianity & they can {u}in a day{/u} when they become
{u}teetotalized{/u} & they will overawe brute England by their mighty
moral character & bring her to [?] sobriety, Christianity unity & peace
& the Irish would make that sea-gem of theirs the Eden of the World in
fifteen years time. {u}Nothing could prevent [it? tear in paper{/u}].
[Present] this to O’Connel [sic] or rather take hold of it yourselves
... Take the simple [leaven? haven?] of nonresistant Christianity & it
will save Ireland as by magic. ... Let Father Mathew finish his work ...
Follow on after him with the simple principle of Non Resistance, as the
panacea for human ills & wars & you make Ireland united, loving,
peaceful, & all her physical power (multiplied a hundred fold by plenty)
& her intellectual power will be found to be laid out on the face of
your Emerald Home & you would make it sparkle like a diamond on the
bosom of the {u}Earth{/u}. ... And would it not be {u}just like{/u}
Providence, if he should select for the example to mankind a people
downtrodden & despised as poor Ireland has been! I think so. I have
rattled off an unpremeditated, unconnected string of notions – Can you
make anything of them? You are just the little company (that we left
there) to begin this work & execute it. ... Father Mathew has cleared
the ground for you. ... Tell O’Connell to lay aside his politics & his
greatness & his reputation & come down among you & undertake this
{u}renovation of Ireland by moral influence alone{/u}. He will see the
right of it, the instant you name it to his {u}lightning{/u} mind. If he
will take heed, well, if not, {u}do it yourselves{/u}, the Webbs, the
Allens & the Haughtons. Forgive me my officiousness. ... If O’Connell
remembers me, I would send my love to him, for I really love the noble
creature. He might return it if he were not a politician & a great man.
A politician is in an unfortunate condition. He is not a free [sic] &
cannot be independent. He always [lacks?] {u}reelection{/u} in [order?]
to his impartiality. If he was in for life the {u}power{/u} would
overthrow him, & if he depends on election, his first duty is to humor
his constituency. Poor O’Connell he is like a lion in a net by reason of
his politics. How glorious it would be to him to {u}abdicate{/u} ... We
are working out a revolution here [in U.S.] against sect & politics.
They are deadly enemies of Anti Slavery & we are driven by their
hostility but to assault them in our own defence to a certain extent.”
