RDW to JAC; Dublin.

“Thy mission has my warmest good wishes and thyself my sincerest
sympathy in the strange circumstances in which thou art placed. Strange
indeed that a man of peace, a friend to the oppressed, and a lover of
impartial & rational liberty, should be frowned [down?],
discountenanced, shunned, or coldly received by the ‘pledged
philanthropy of England.’ ... It has tested in my estimation the perfect
truth of Rogers’s estimate of much which, though showy & boastful, is at
heart false and rotten in our English love of liberty & free discussion.
... [Doubts whether they would have success in Ireland because of recent
fundraising trips by Birney, Stanton and Scoble, and by Oberlin
fundraisers.] Garrison & Rogers carried away golden opinions of our
Irish Anti Slavery, but this was merely because they were thrown into
the very circle of those who have the subject most at heart. The number
is altogether not much above half a dozen. These are neither rich nor
influential. There are however many others who can be interested and who
are much better able to {u}give{/u} than the few I have alluded to. ...
We take the Liberator, the N.A.S. Standard, the Non Resistant, the
Herald of Freedom, & the Pennsylvania Freeman – and since the Convention
I hardly read any thing else. ...
