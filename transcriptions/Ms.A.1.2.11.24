**[1841, 01-12] Ms.A.1.2.11.24**

JAC to Thomas Clarkson; London. {Rough draft/copy}

“This evenings post brought me an ‘Express’ containing a letter from
yourself to Mr Alexander, censuring me in terms somewhat severe for the
course I persued [sic?] at Ipswich with respect to that gentleman. I
made no allusion to yourself only to illustrate the opposition I
received from Mr. Alexander. Unwilling to trouble you Mr Remond & myself
wrote to your daughter explaining the cause of any reference being made
to yourself in the ‘Express,’ which we hoped would prove satisfactory.
[p] I cannot see what other course we could have persued [sic?] in
Ispwich, but to have left the place at the suggestion of Mr Alexander.
[Recounts the letter from Alexander asking them not to pursue a visit to
Playford Hall, and also criticizing Alexander for going ahead to
Playford to poison Clarkson against them. Clarkson was apparently taking
the side of Alexander in the Express article.]
