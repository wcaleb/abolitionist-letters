Thomas, Thomas Felix, to JAC. Clarkson’s letter. Proper action to be
taken. Must be “as harsh as truth.”

“There is a letter from the venerable Clarkson to RD Alexander & some
state^ts^ of the latter wh I find you have seen. The {u}points{/u} of
each communication should {u}be noticed{/u} and yet probably it would be
deemed invidious on {u}yr part{/u} to expose the weakness of an {u}Old
Man{/u} like Mr Clarkson. {u}Avoid this{/u}, & turn the [shaft?] of yr
displeasure upon the old Quaker. He richly deserved whatever you can
send him in the shape of a gentlemanly & just rebuke. ... [Informs JAC
of the letter from Colver circulated by the Broad Street committee
denouncing Garrison and insinuating that JAC left America under
suspicious circumstances. Clarkson had maintained that he gave money to
JAC as an individual, not a society, which demands a rebuke.]
