MWC to WLG; Cap Haitien.

“[Wants to provide information on Hayti for the Liberator.] But it
requires time to observe for oneself & to verify what one hears from
others respecting a country entirely new & unknown to us. I wish we
would have brought with us tracts suitable for general distribution
among the people touching the anti slavery cause, as many read English.
... Why will you not prepare a short account of the Anti Slavery
movement in the United States from its beginning – something by which to
inform the popular mind here of the interest felt for universal freedom
& for the darker race to whom it is denied in the U.S., by a small but
increasing portion of the people there? I see enough daily of the
kindness of heart & sympathising [sic] spirits of the Haitians to feel
confident that they would be deeply interested by an article of this
kind. Enjoying Freedom themselves, they would sympathise [sic] deeply
with those who are striving to attain it, for their oppressed people in
a land which they are [induced?] to look upon with just detestation from
the ill treatment to which they are exposed when they visit it, & which
refuses to acknowledge the national independence they have won so
dearly. Though they feel these things deeply, there is no symptom to be
discerned of a retaliatory spirit. They seem, on the contrary, to
delight in showing kindness to strangers of a different complexion from
themselves. [p] Should you prepare such an article as I suggest & cause
an extra 1000 copies of the Liberator to be struck off (charge to us)
perhaps it would be well to have the whole paper made up of such
articles as would tell well upon this Island, not forgetting to state
that the opposition to freedom is so far beaten down in some parts of
the country among Americans, as to have taken the name of abolition,
while striving covertly to quell the spirit of Freedom. In the
miscellaneous department I would suggest the republication, from the
[Penny?] Magazine.for March 1838, of Harriet Martineau’s account of
Toussaint L’Ouverture, & in the non-resistance department some article
on the expediency of a forgiving spirit & the moral excellency of
abjuring violence & revenge & returning good for evil, directing
attention to the Life of Christ as an exemplification. There is little
or nothing of {u}technical{/u} religion here; which is one obstacle the
less to the promulgation of true religion. There is here immorality but
not hypocrisy: with professedly Christian nations of the North, there is
both immorality & hypocrisy. For the same reason that Christ & the
disciples went first to the cities of Israel rather than to the
gentiles, would I have the gospel preached in Boston in preference to
Cap Haitien – they need it more in their state of phariseeism than do
these in their state of comparative simplicity. ... If you [could? water
stain blots out the word] give an abstract of the progress of the Anti
Slavery course, pray give a copy of the petitions we have circulated
with so much vigour for the abrogation of laws founded on distinctions
of colour & for the recognition of Haitian independence by our Govt.”

[Postscript:] “If it were thought expedient, the article in the Lib.
might be both in French & English. Mrs. Follen or my sisters would
translate it for you into French.”

[Mentions a John Candler & wife, a minister of the Society of Friends,
whom she suspects as a “judicious” and “philanthropic” man would have
sympathized with “Old Org” if he had been “tried in our New England
furnace.”]
