JAC to RDW; Darlington.

“Though I never had the pleasure of seeing your face but for all that I
feel well acquainted with you. I have read your spirit & character in
your speeches & through our beloved Garrison. And there is Richard Allen
& Mr Smeal & John Murray, I know them all. I have seen their hearts, --
I have communed with their spirits; -- dales mountains nor oceans cannot
separate the spirit. It is subtle & intangible. ... I shall be greatly
disappointed if I have to return home without seeing Dublin, for I have
seen but 5, as yet genuine abolitionists in all the kingdom, of the
{u}Cornhill{/u} school. [p] The abolitionists I have met with, have been
laced up in sectarian jackets & screwed up like the bride in the ball
room, unable to step to the music. This country is all opposed to negro
slavery, but it must be abolished by the square and compass. It must be
done without agitation – Without removing the dead carcass of a Quaker
Methodist, Baptist &c if perchance they stand upon freedom’s track. The
car must stop, or go round. Their [sic] must be no crying aloud to wake
up their drowsy energies. Not this would be worse to each respective
sect in this country than slavery itself. The principles must be
conformed to their respective tastes. The principles must come down to
them & not they to the principles. We have done this in America, & you
have pretty nearly done this in Great Britain. New-organization is the
panacea. But this narcotic would be too powerful for Englishmen were
they in America. New organization would be in this country radicalism
run mad.”
