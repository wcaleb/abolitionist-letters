WLG to John Harfield Tredgold. Resolutions of the MASS; Collins; the
world’s conference [the last not mentioned in the published version;
there is a second page to the letter that is omitted in the published
letters!].

“At the ninth annual meeting of the Massachusetts Anti Slavery Society
held 27^th^ and 28^th^ January at the Marlborough Chapel, the following
Resolutions were unanimously adopted.

Resolved that the transmutation of the Worlds Convention, summoned to
assemble at London, on the 12^th^ of June 1840, into a Conference with
the British and Foreign A. S. Society, was an act of usurpation upon the
rights of the Abolitionists of the World, by the Committee of that
Society, wholly unauthorized by reason or usage, and as such meets with
our unqualified and decided disapprobation.

Resolved that the exclusion of a portion of the duly appointed delegates
of this Society and of the American A.S. Society by that body, on
account of their Sex, was an act unworthy of their character as
Abolitionists and a high insult to the Societies whose representatives
were thus unworthily treated.

[Resolved to approve the actions of those who refused seats.]

Resolved, That the refusal of that conference to enter upon its minutes
the protest of the minority against this violation of the rights of
their Constituents was an assumption of despotic power more worthy of a
Slavery [large space; missing word?] American Congress than of a solemn
assemblage of British Philanthropists.”
