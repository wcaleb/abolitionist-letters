Bradburn, George, to EPN; Boston. Can’t believe Colver’s slanders of
JAC.

“Notwithstanding the London Convention was not what it should have been,
{u}I{/u} shall always rejoice that it was called, for this reason, if
for no other, that it proved the {u}occasion{/u} of my seeing England,
Scotland, Ireland, and France, and making, in those countries, a goodly
number of interesting and highly valued acquaintances. I doubt not,
either, that the Convention will have done something for the negro.
Whittier and Rogers have both spoken of it in terms somewhat
exaggerated; but some latitude of expression is allowable to [?].”
