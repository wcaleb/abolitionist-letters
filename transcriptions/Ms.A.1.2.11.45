Bassett, William, to EPN; Lynn. Denounces Colver’s slanders as
“{u}false{/u} & {u}libellous{/u}.” Garrison did not sign the call for
the Chardon Street Convention, and there were no “no marriage
perfectionists” present. Colver was present at the State Annual meeting.
Mentions the Chapmans leaving for Hayti.

“He admitted the authorship & undertook to defend them, in doing which
he manifested the most unblushing impudence & the most reckless
disregard of truth. Some of the reasons which he gave for his assertions
were most wonderful – For instance he termed the Sabbath Convention an
‘infidel Convention’ because {u}one of its members{/u} said that the
phrase ‘Thus saith the Lord’ prefixed to the levitical laws, meant the
same as ‘Be it enacted’! Moreover, he considered the views held by
Garrison & some of his friends respecting the Sabbath, the Church, & the
Ministry to be {u}infidelity{/u} & {u}therefore{/u} it was an ‘infidel
Convention.’’
