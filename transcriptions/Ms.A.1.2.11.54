Rawson, Mary Anne, to JAC; near Sheffield. The behavior of the BFASS
criticised; causes of the split; Garrison should be upheld.

“The course pursued by the New Broad Street Committee, strikes me as
most unfair and uncourteous; -- indeed the feeling of English
abolitionists generally towards the long-tried friends of the slave in
America is, to me, perfectly unaccountable. [Confesses imperfect
knowledge of the causes of the American schism, but expresses the
opinion that women’s rights should not have distracted either party from
opposition to slavery.] ... Whatever differences of opinion there may be
on minor points, it appears to me, to be a paramount duty of English
Abolitionists to uphold Garrison & his friends – We may go the world
over, and where shall we find their equals?” ... “Our Committee are very
well-meaning people but poor & uninfluential, with the exception of Mrs
JC Walker, & I am sorry to say that she has been prejudiced on this
question by Birney & Scoble. – They spent two days at her house, and
after their visit she came to me quite in a fright, thinking that we had
been quite deceived in our opinion of Garrison & that she had done very
wrong in sending a box of Bazaar things by him to the American Ladies. I
succeeded in disabusing her mind in some degree, but her interest is
evidently lessened from what she has heard from the other side.”
