“You will perhaps be surprised to hear from me at this distance from
Boston. My husband’s health was the cause of it primarily. We left home
for his sake, & came here rather than any where else, for the sake of
the cause. If we should find a republick [sic] of men of colour [sic],
all going on harmoniously in the path to civilization, it would we
thought, subserve the cause of the slave in our own republic [sic]. We
have been greatly gratified since our arrival here, by much that we have
observed, & find nothing which candour would not compel us to account
for without supposing the blacks to be an inferior race to others. But
much as I should delight to dwell on the particulars of our sojourn here
– much as I could find it in my heart to inflict upon you in the way of
confirmatory statisticks [sic] which we have gathered, or in describing
these blue & purple mountains – these splendid & variously dyed seas,
these ruins of a departed despotism – from which ‘each crumbling arch –
each column lone ‘pleads haughtily for glories gone[’] – Glowing as I
might be disposed to be in description or dull in statisticks [sic], I
am impelled by the accounts I have just had from Boston, to turn to
another subject. The sent me from there an attested copy of our dear
friend Collins’ last letter, giving an account of the malignant attack
of Colver upon himself & upon Garrison. ... [Goes on and on about this.
Dismisses Colver’s implications that Garrison had headed an “Infidel
Convention” and that Garrison’s influence is on the wane.]
