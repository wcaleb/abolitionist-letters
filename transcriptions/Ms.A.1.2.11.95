JAC to EQ; Glasgow.

“I have not time, my friend, to write you a letter, -- I have only time
to say among a few other things that the people of this country will not
consent to my leaving this month. In fact I do not think our cause would
allow by leaving now. Things have gone too far to effect an honorable
retreat. Britain is taking sides. The leaven now has got into the lump,
which never before has been the case. The world’s convention! did not
bring it about. With but few exceptions all sympathised with New Broad
St. They did not understand the question. But the base acts of the
London Committee is effecting a revolution. I am almost daily receiving
letters from valuable men, begging to know the causes of the division
&c. Many, very many, who were strong with the com. last June are now
breaking loose.
