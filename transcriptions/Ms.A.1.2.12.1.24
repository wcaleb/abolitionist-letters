WP to EPN; n.p.

“I do not expect to understand this sugar question or at least the
political aspect of it till we get onto English ground. Every paper I
get only gives me some hint at the position of English Abolitionists
which renders the whole matter darker than before.”

JAC to WP. “The good people in Ireland or, at least in Dublin, would be
most happy to make her [Ann’s] & your own visit to this city agreeable.
They wish me to urge you to come. I am confident that no earnestness
need be expressed upon my part. If your health and circumstances will
permit. I know that will delight to honor the devoted Philanthropists of
Ireland with your company & if not, I could not urge it. [p] There are
about ¾ of dozen men here, the most remarkable men I ever had the honor
or the pleasure to meet with. They are not men of fortune, but business
men in the common acceptation of the term – Dependent upon the trades or
professions for the enjoyments of the means necessary to an existence,
yet one half of their time is actually devoted to the cause of
benevolence. [They meet regularly every Wednesday.] ... With the
benevolence of a May, the logic of a Quincy, the eloquence of (almost) a
Phillips, the energy and executiveness of a Maria W. Chapman & the
clearness and disinterestedness of a Garrison, they are enabled so to
sustain the cause of Peace, Abolition, Temperance, British India &c with
such ability as to effect the feelings & habits of entire population of
Ireland, to a very considerable extent [sic]. They not only give their
time but their purse strings are never closely drawn. ... To be with
them would do your soul good. [p] You will see E. Pease, a choice
spirit, a giant’s heart, with a soul so elastic as to feel for the whole
universe. I regret, however, that herself, & Thompson and others have
got so deeply drawn into the meshes of political chicanery,
unconsciously, however. I have ever looked with suspicion upon the
movements of the British India Society, not but [what?] I felt that
Adam, the Peases & Thompson were honest & deeply sensible of the wrongs
inflicted upon the poor Indians. But I knew that the reform contemplated
could never be effected by the means employed. ... It is a species of
colonization – a go between. The first thing to be done, by the
advocates of Justice to British India, is to attack the British
Government & demand that India shall be instantly set free. Attack that
cursed East India Company – Let it be shown that Britain acquired the
Indies by force & sustains it by force & therefore should instantly let
the oppressed Indians go free. [Thompson has agreed to join the
ministerial party] ... If Thompson wishes to promote the cause of truth
by ‘{u}political action{/u}’ let him get into Parliament & get the
weight & influence which it would confer as politics & political
revolutions are not brought about by the power of truth but by the
character, standing & influence of those who advocate the reform. The
sugar question is a political humbug which the government has introduced
hoping to play upon the poverty of the country for political ends, but
to the great astonishment they found that the tory party had turned
abolitionists! Thompson is agitating this question also. Well let him do
it. I am for beginning all reforms, by appealing to the conscience of
the people & when that conscience acts, corresponding statutes will
follow.”
