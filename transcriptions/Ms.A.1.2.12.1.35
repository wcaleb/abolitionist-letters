“[JAC] is gone to Glasgow again in order to take [some?] further part in
the Battle Royal which his presence has called forth in the midst of
Glasgow Anti Slavery. Rogers’s estimate of British Abolition {u}in the
mass{/u} is the right one, and therefore who need wonder that it cannot
withstand the power of the clergy or burst through the trammels of sect.
... [Webb finds Collins to be honest and straightforward.] His mode of
procedure may not be the best for the collection of {u}golden{/u}
opinions, or for the lightening of purses, but is it not better for the
eventual success of your cause & the progress of truth that the true
principles of liberty and moral independence should be accepted by a few
who are willing to receive them, than that you should receive temporary
assistance from rich men who would reject you with scorn & hatred if
they were conscious of the soul exalting tendency of your large hearted
philanthropy? ... [Joseph Sturge is worth conciliating.] ... [List of

EMD to EPN; Philadelphia. Action of the London Committee criticised;
meeting of Gurley and Scoble; Garrison and Burleigh compared; faults of
constitution; GT’s health.

“I am glad to find thee feels so great an interest in the Liberator. It
is the most interest & the best periodical in the world. One great
advantage which its Editor has over those of the Standard & Freeman in
that he is not bound down by any Constitution. He dares to tell the
whole truth upon all the subjects in which he takes an interest. Not so
with Burleigh though a thorough nonresistant, and {u}Human rights{/u}
man, and an ultra in every thing good, yet he feels not at liberty in
the columns of the Freeman to discuss any thing but Anti Slavery. Rogers
too has the same platform to work upon, but he has so restless a spirit
and his whole being is so full of ardour, that he not unfrequently leaps
the Anti Slavery barrier into the broad open field of common humanity.
By our Constitution we have hedged ourselves up, and though our objects
are glorious and our platform wide yet it is too narrow for a free soul.
Still I am opposed to breaking it down, for those whose expansive souls
yearn for a wider field, can find such in other ways than breaking down
our enclosure.”
