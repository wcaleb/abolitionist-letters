goodbye.}

“Often do I recur to the feelings excited in my mind on reading the
remarks on India ‘by {u}an American Abolitionist{/u}’ – from them I
think I can trace a good deal of the [little?] feeling I have on behalf
of British India – from them I have formed some idea of the part she has
to achieve in breaking down American Slavery. [p] But my friend, there
is a dark cloud on India! Slavery exists – aye & [riots?] in all its
horrors there. Slavery I fear exists in India to an extent which few of
us ever dreamt of! [p] A short time since the number of bondsmen
[there?] was I think estimated at about 300,000. Subsequent examination
raised it to 800,000 – while now I fear a closer examination proves the
fact that {u}millions{/u} of down trodden slaves are scattered over
India’s surface – who are bough & sold, husband & wife separated,
manacled, flogged, abused, degraded even as the American slave is, & the
West Indian bondsmen were! [The BFASS has commenced a study of this
subject, revealing] that {u}millions{/u} of slaves in all probability
toil under British India’s sway -- & that not only does a very extensive
internal slave trade exist, not only too are East Indian subjects
kidnapped, & carried away captives into other lands in exchange for
{u}other{/u} slaves, but that the African slave trade itself is
supported by {u}India{/u} – that numbers of Africa’s children are
introduced even into the cities in which are the seats of the British
Government – that African children are so valuable there, that their
owners cannot let them out into the streets for fear of being kidnapped.
[p] Such then is India! Such is the position of England too, though
vaunting herself in the fancied entire abolition of slavery! [So
shouldn’t the abolitionists cry for immediate abolition in India before
seeking to develop its resources in an attempt to overthrow slave
economy in America?]”
