JAC to RDW; Boston. Re: Creole case.

“I cannot see by what principle of english law the authorities of N.P.
[New Providence] imprisoned those who were accused of murder. England
does not recognize slavery to be right. Slavery cannot exist within the
pale of her influence. Now supposing this vessel had been an Algerian
vessel & the few white men on board had been Algerenes [sic] and the 147
negroes had been American gentlemen & these American Gents had murdered
some of these Algerenes & had run the vessel into N.P. think you the
British authorities would have imprisoned them for such patriotism? I
tell you nay – Then British influence is somewhat in favor of slavery or
at least it caters somewhat to the slave holding prejudices of the
19^th^ century. It is however a great victory that so many should be
left to go free. I wish your society would correspond with the proper
English authorities on this point of the question, which imprisoned
these patriots. It is a new Amistad case, & no doubt grew out of it. It
shows that such intelligence gets among our {u}things{/u} and moves them
to aspire for freedom. ...”
