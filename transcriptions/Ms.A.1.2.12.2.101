HCW to EPN. Dublin. His arrival in Dublin; his health. “I forwarded
several letters to you, by Post, from Liverpool. I have a great many
messages of affection & gratitude from several in the U. States, to be
delivered by word of mouth, & which can be delivered in no other way.
Indeed, you are enshrined in many warm & noble hearts there. Surely a
new spirit is coming over the world. The hearts of {u}individuals{/u}
are being knit together, though oceans & continents roll & stretch
between them. Will it be possible for ambitious rulers & politicians to
dash {u}Nations{/u} against each other when {u}individuals{/u} love each
other & salute each other, as it were, morn & eve? I think not.” … He
has missed seeing Thompson in Glasgow, “but George Thompson belongs to
the world, & is doing his work the other side of the globe.”
