Richard Allen to WP. “our Lord Mayor [O’Connell] & his son John have
come out strongly on the slavery question in the midst of Repeal
contributions from America. I have sent W.L. Garrison a history of
the[ir?] continual adherence [to?] the Anti Slavery cause – I have never
[seen?] the least danger of O’Connell, but we were a little afraid that
your Repeal contributions might silence in [degree?] the national voice
against your {u}[especial?] sin{/u}. My head is full of thoughts, which
my paper will not allow room for – Here we have the iniquitous Chinese
war upon our hands, & it seems about impossible to stem the public
opinion going the wrong way. [Geo. Thompson continues speaking
eloquently in the Anti Corn Law agitation.]
