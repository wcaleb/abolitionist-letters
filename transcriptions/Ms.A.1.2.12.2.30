“I have always had an intense desire to see and to know those I greatly
honored and admired. When I visited Paris in 1831 my chief attraction
was the hope of seeing Lafayette who was then {u}my idol{/u}. This is a
true word, for there is I am confident in many minds an unconscious [?]
to the notable, the comprehensible in preference to the Incomprehensible
and the Unseen – a preference of the great creation over the great
Creator. The love of the outward exhibitions of goodness greatness and
beauty is often intense where the sentiment of devotion is comparatively
weak Perhaps I should say of {u}abstract{/u}, {u}technical{/u} devotion.
... But I have wandered far away from my starting point. In 1840
Lafayette was dead, and not only dead but deposed, and Garrison fairly
seated in his place. When I went to the convention the hope of seeing
him was my Star of Bethlehem, and my disappointment was intense when it
appeared probable he wd not come. At last he came, but before I knew him
it was [?] that he would not attend the convention on account of the
decision of the “Woman Question.” ... [Then Rogers introduced he and
Hannah to Garrison.] I asked them to our lodgings – they came – I sat by
him or behind him in the Gallery of Freemasons Hall like a little Paul
at the feet of Gamaliel. ... [First paragraph in {u}BAA{/u}. Sturge
viewed as a “Radical” by Quakers in Ireland because of his position on
the Corn Laws, “and yet he is, compared with you, a staunch
conservative.”] The Pooles in [Winford?], the Fishers in Limerick, the
Jennings’s and H.E. White (my cousin) in Cork, Maria Waring (my sister
in law with the courage of Abby Kelley) in Waterford, these all are
young women. They, with our Committee, are the representatives of Irish
Anti Slavery as an active living principle. New Organization flourishes
in Belfast and is dead elsewhere, and does little even there. [Second
paragraph in {u}BAA{/u}.] ... Our committee consists of 4 quakers, 3
unitarians, 1 methodist. the last carefully abstains from any of our
‘extraneous topics.’ He is only a very stomach & zealous teetotaller.
... I send herewith the original manuscript of O’Connell’s longest work,
just published. It is not all in his writing. Only the {u}title page{/u}
& the {u}interlineations{/u}. I printed it. The greater part of the
handwriting, indeed the body of the Mss., is by O’Neill [Dacent?] his
secretary, and himself an author. I kept the Manuscript by Daniels
express permission. I have thought in this age of autograph collecting
it would bring something particularly in America, where there are so
many of his admirers. ... Every thing about Remond will interest us
here. I am afraid I affronted him permanently by taking on myself the
thankless office of a mentor on one or two occasions. I am sure my hints
did him good, but the did not do me any in his opinion. Nobody takes
bitter doses and he got so much ‘butter and honey’ in Paddyland that his
taste was spoiled for the rugged lessons of ‘grizzly saints and martyrs
hairy’ – like me. Dont tell him I said so, or he will hate me
altogether. He is a fine fellow after all (that is, tho’ he is vexed
with me) and he {u}conducted{/u} (as you see in America) with marvellous
discretion and great faithfulness towards the friends of the cause in
America.”
