Allen, Richard, to WLG; Dublin. {Edited for the Lib.? I’m transcribing
the edited version.}

“Thanks to thee for many things! for thy sympathy towards my loved &
suffering land! for thy desires that she should be free, prosperous &
happy! for thy earnest wishes that she may stand forth increasingly as
the Temperance beacon, as the moral regenerator of the earth. but ten
folds thanks to thee for having stood forth as her Champion against
those low & dastardly spirits who would represent her looking on your
{u}abomination{/u} of {u}abominations{/u}, slavery, with other than eyes
of the [deepest?] detestation. ... Yes – for the sake of my country, for
the sake of the Irish spirit in America, let thy noble vindication of
her insulted character, be printed & reprinted, & scattered broadcast
over the land, let no Irish house be without it, let there be no infant
[prattler?] who names the name of Ireland as the home of his fathers, or
as the land which he loves, who may not have it by him, as a something
by which he may learn to [?] – to sharpen feelings for freedom – his
detestation of slavery! [p] But it is a vain attempt ... to gainsay the
fact that the Irish here detest slavery, & particularly American
slavery. Oh! could such grovellers as those of your enthusiasts about
Irish repeal, who nevertheless, cherish despotism in the lowest depths
of their hearts, but come with us in one of our frequent visits to
O’Connell, & see his full, beaming cordial face, warmly [denouncing
slavery etc etc. ... ] ... could they have seen the cordiality with
which Father Mathew walked into my house, and laid down the roll with
his name attached to it, could they too come into our crowded meetings
at the Royal Exchange & hear the burst of applause which even the
mention of Anti Slavery calls forth, could mark the similar
demonstration with which it is received in the Repeal meetings ...
[Postscript laments the continuation of the Chinese and India wars.]
