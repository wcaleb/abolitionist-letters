Bassett, William, to EPN; Lynn.

[Describes his financial hardships in the recent economic downturns,
which has left him on the brink of bankruptcy. He has liquidated all his
property to satisfy his creditors. Gives Quaker news.] ... “How prospers
the British India movement? I was greatly disappointed & surprised on
hearing from Prof. Adam his views of the inefficiency of the committee,
& of their indisposition to meddle with the subject of {u}Slavery{/u} in
India. I had hoped & believed that its Abolition would be a prominent
object of their labors; & that they would occupy a position in the work
of reform, far above that of the London A.S. Committee. I trust,
however, that there are many spirits there, who will not rest satisfied
with any superficial or partial movement, but will insist on the removal
of every thing wh. prevents the entire mental & physical enfranchisement
of any portion of the human family.”
