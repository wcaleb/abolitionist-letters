“You will see by the Lib^r^ that we are all red hot against against
[sic] O’Connell and with good reason. I quote to every one a half
prophecy you made to me at Liverpool where I asked what you thought of
him & your character for second sight rises in proportion. Tis the
beginning of the end. He dares not face the demon when it touches
{u}him{/u}. He would be proslavery this side the pond – ‘a mere peeler’
as we say – He won’t shake hands with slaveholders no – but he will
shake their gold. Fool how little he knows his real interest this side
the water. The only fame he had is gone. We (Americans) only
[{u}feared{/u}?] him, now all will despise, the abolitionists his little
soul, the rest believing he has been bullied or cajoled from his
position, the tool of barroom demagogues! The repeal movement in this
country is a sincere enthusiasm among the illiterate Irish & that is
{u}used{/u} for their own purposes by interested men, it never will
amount to any thing simply because while it shouts ‘repeal’ & looks at
Ireland, like Bunyan’s boatman it [zoars? looks?] the other way & means
‘office.’ Well I suppose he was as honest as politicians ever can be.
... Well we could [do] without him. Anti Slavery kisses no man’s toe.
... [Thanks James Haughton] for his glorious bearding of the ‘Lion’ in
his very den. His letter will be felt. A common Irishman spoke quite
excited about it to me here. I don’t know that I think the
{u}principle{/u} of refusing contributions from slaveholders absolutely
{u}necessary{/u}: and don’t deem me above to be blaming O’Connell for
not {u}refusing{/u} them. I blame him I almost scorn him for letting his
noble life be clogged with gold so that he only stammers faintly, in
half & half words. Where’s that thunder blast that he boasted should
career [careen?] against the wind. All his wiry edge is gone. O’Connell
is become Dr Channing, & ‘instead of mounting barbed steeds, he capers
mainly in a lady’s chamber to the [?] pleasing of a [?].’ But to noble
friend Haughton, we have almost the same question up here & I’ve taken
ground somewhat opposed to Haughton (But the noble stand he took is all
the same admired). You may have observed that S.S. Foster proposed in
the American society a resolution to send back money contributed to it
by Fowell Buxton on the ground of its coming from a dealer in Liquors,
which intoxicate. He has brought it up again in one of our county
societies. I think it unnecessary to take that ground as we are not a
Temperance Society. ... Beside, if we lay down that we will not take any
money which is tainted by ill doing or oppression, where shall we stop.
As C C Burleigh said to Foster, ‘will you pass with me a resolution not
to take money from those who {u}deal{/u} in slave produce!! One friend,
I know thinks all hiring & wages of the devil & slavery to spring from
this bitter root. Suppose he should say we would not take money from any
one who [?] his property by employing others for hire, or that I should
say I would take no money from a dry goods dealer because the English
Operatives were starved – every English Cambric is as stiff with human
blood to my eyes as the cotton of Louisiana. Shall we settle all the
question on an Anti Slavery platform? If we do, what shall we do next,
dig our fields with our fingers for {u}iron{/u} shovels come from mines
where oppression shuns the light. Ask friend Haughton whether he thinks
the repeal cause being one of freedom & bound therefore not to sanction
its own peculiar opponent slavery, is reason sufficient to take the case
mentioned in his letter out of my argument. I am not sure but it is.
