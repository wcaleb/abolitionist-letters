“I send you herewith all the paper of 1841 ... the 31 of 1831. ... Dr
Channing’s {u}two{/u} last works may interest you, even if already seen,
by their American Dress. The constitution of our state may be worth a
moments glance from a Chartist! like yourself as soon as II get a
conveniently small one of the United States I will send it. The papers
(Post) give an account of the {u}right of suffrage{/u} in {u}all{/u} the
{u}states{/u} (the United States Cons lays down none) which is
substantially accurate though not wholly so. The ‘residence’ referred to
is in most if not all cases required to be {u}immediately preceding the
election{/u}. ... I see your Gen^l^ Suffrage movement & debate does not
refer to {u}residence{/u} as a qualification. Another point in New
England we have lists of voters made out if a man’s name is not on the
list he can’t {u}vote{/u}, if it ought to be there his {u}remedy{/u} is
to sue the Selectmen or Mayor for the loss of his vote & see that it is
put on before another election. ... I was struck by the reflection in
reading the Suffrage Conv. which you were so kind as to send me that
little or no reference was made to our example on the questions. Why we
have proved by trial & settled the matter of the ballot – the propriety
of having {u}one{/u} branch of the Legislature {u}annually{/u} elective,
the danger alluded to of each successive house wasting time before they
become accustomed to routine is not {u}practical{/u}, for as a matter of
fact the same members at least two thirds of them are reelected the
{u}body{/u} is the same well instructed & oiled for use. ... I suppose
you have heard ere this full accounts of our anniversaries which were
really spirited. Garrison made a great speech on {u}our{/u} Repeal &
every thing was lovely as [Spirit?]. ... Your {u}pet{/u} CL Remond (dont
laugh at me for calling him so tis only in jest) acquitted him right
well, & grows in favor daily, his speech still smacks of England! ...
[Discusses free produce movement; lack of support for it, for isn’t all
produce ultimately tainted in some way?] Indeed it would end by digging
the ground with our fingers for shovels & ploughs have come from mines
where atrocious oppression shuns the light. Yet we have called on the
Missionary Societies {u}some{/u} of us, to refuse money from
Slaveholders, by the by the question is similar to Haughton’s advice to
O’Connell to refuse the Repeal money from England – Ten thousand thanks
crest every wave from America to him for that glorious courageous stand
– Shout for the hero, but though Repeal being a cause of Freedom might
consistently perhaps refuse to receive money from friends & holders of
slaves, still I am not sure but what it falls under my argument. ...”
