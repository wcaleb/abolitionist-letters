Bradburn, George, to RDW.

“On my return from a late tour among the Heathen of the Commonwealth and
elsewhere, I found a large number of Irish papers, which I have had a
pleasure in looking over, though most of them were old. Thanks to all of
you for the same. If {u}I{/u} abstain from sending papers to my Irish
friends, it is only because I know there are so many others, who are
constantly sending them such favors.” [Praises JQA.]

RDW to MWC; Dublin.

“Richard Allen had a letter a few days since from W.L.G. He bewails the
falling away of the Irish. No wonder. They are there as here led by
their priests and demagogues, and will huzza and applaud any thing that
either say. ... The cry for the repeal of the union has no vitality in
Ireland except among the mob in Dublin and a few enthusiasts throughout
the country, who encourage hopes of national independence which there
seems little chance of seeing realized, & I dont know how far it would
be desirable that they should be. Politics and Political efforts and
politicians are full of unsoundness, and void of principle, and slaves
of the Tyrant Expediency.”
