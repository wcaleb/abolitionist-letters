[Re: First of August.] “The bells rung out their merry peals at dawn,
noon & sunset, quite a new thing in Anti Slavery; indeed I know not any
other town where they {u}could{/u} have hired the bells for such an
occasion – goodly Anti Slavery {u}lecturers{/u} they were, few circles
but must needs ask why the noise was & few where some one would not be
found to tell, though heeded then for the first time, the kind of day
that was dawning. Now shall I not be somewhat Webbish! if I say then if
no time else every steeple had its {u}Liberty Bell{/u} ... & say they
served to {u}awaken{/u} the townspeople at least. ... The procession was
quite picturesque the first moment I cam in sight of it, now appearing,
now hid in the outskirts of the grove they were entering, their various
colored dresses contrasting beautifully with the dark mass of sunlit
foliage behind & above. It reminded me of Scotts picture of the
Templars, some in black & some in surplice, quitting Ashby at Richards
Order. But why cumber the Atlantic with tedious prosing descriptions
like these! ... How by the way is Dan fallen. Little does he dream that
his shuffling has made shipwreck of all his American fame, for out of
those who will pity him for it, there are few here to whom his very name
has not been a contemptible abomination. ... I tell the third party men
it proves how little trust can be reposed in the {u}best{/u} politicians
in the {u}best{/u} circumstances, & yet they can’t dream of having
1/100^th^ the part of their timber half as sound as Danl. ... I hardly
see how you all get a moment to spare for us in the midst of such
thrilling scenes as surround you – what an overturning. How gloriously
you are working, out for the world, the the [sic] evidence what trifles
war & revolutions by the battlefield are compared with those of the book
sphere. Napoleon dwindles beside ‘English Dissent’ which I take it in
its various forms is the parent of modern liberty. God grant the
struggle may be bloodless & take its place beside West India
Experiments, betwixt Orion & the Pleiades for the gaze of the world.
While the East Indian shouts for monopoly, the Church for supremacy, can
you hear the far off cry of the slave? Like Dan (of old) your
philanthropists must be ‘shoreless.’ I think (all wrong as I deem him
perhaps it shows I can’t think him {u}all{/u} wrong) H.C.W. will do good
among the conflicting heated masses of society which as crazy Irving
once said ‘crash & jostle against each other like mighty vessels in a
storm.’ Did you suck a great deal of news from Tom Davis? I hardly know
where his stand is now. He was right when I left here for Europe, but so
many have waked up & found themselves somebody else since that, I would
not undertake from the little I’ve seen of him since my return to say he
was more than in the land of the living. ... Does it never seem to you
when dreaming of the oppressions that are done under the sun from
Nicholas with his 14 million serfs to the domestic in the outer room of
a false social system, that the work is greater than we can attempt, &
so hopeless that one might a well keep his own heart with all diligence
& give up the hope of leaving the world any better than he found it? But
then to be sure we were not sent into the world to abolish slavery or
feed the hungry, but to do our duty & leave both those good things to
result if they will – if they dont, it is not then our fault –
consequences are Gods. There is a sense in which it is true we were not
born to {u}do{/u} good but {u}be{/u} good, & it savors of arrogance in
[?] to {u}presume{/u} so much as to be disappointed that our good has
not {u}done{/u} all the good we expected to others, as if {u}we{/u} were
very important in the great plan, as if God could not find worthier
coworkers.”
