[Re: First of August. Basically repeats the bell paragraph from his
letter on the same day to Webb.] ... “I want you … to write me a letter,
telling the names of leading men, members of Parlia., & speakers among
the Chartists—how many votes they can count on in [the] H.C.—any
statistics about them. Which article they shall find the *best*, if
there are indeed any, in the Quarterly Review about them. &c. I have by
C.L.R.’s kindness the Charter & your pamphlets & our newspapers throw
much light on their movements. [He plans to write a lecture for the
lyceum about them, and wants any information she can provide.] “I never
understood the (unjust) tiger like strength of your *Government* till
now. Here light does not follow the day quicker than our Governt.
changes at the peoples bidding.” [After {u}BAA{/u} excerpt ...] ... my
people go’ – like him in their defiance of the finger of God they fight,
with a courage fearful to see, against the stars in the courses. It has
something, at least to us at a distance, of sublimity, though savoring
of Satan’s character, perhaps that ‘{u}though{/u}’ should be
‘{u}and{/u}.’ Miltons Satan was always sublime. Dont think I forget
India. Our papers are still wrangling about it & its cotton experiment,
but as there’s nothing new I don’t send them. I sent a while ago to G.T.
a few newspapers containing a series of articles trying to show that the
same {u}seeming{/u} increase took place once before but led to nothing
important, & that this time it was wholly owing to the closing of the
China market. There was nothing new about them but I thought he might
use them in his lectures. Did I send you a series from a Richmond paper
published in our Atlas & Courier, speaking {u}fearfully{/u} of it if I
did not I will, but I think I did. Tis a great movement & I hope will
yet strike off 4000000 Indian fetters & its {u}rebound{/u} knock ours
away. How is mighty Dan fallen! [Echoes same paragraph on Dan in letter
to Webb.] ... Thank you now if I have not before for all papers &
especially that of Manchester Anti Corn ministers & the Suffrage Conv.
Amid such thrilling scenes, the peasant crying for bread, the citizen
for ballot, the E Ind Soc for monopoly, the Church for supremacy, the
landowner for booty, How can you find time for us or hear the far off
cry of the slave. How gloriously you are working out for the world the
evidence what trifles Revolutions & battlefields are beside books & the
pen. Napoleon dwindles before ‘English Dissent’ the mother (in the form
of Puritan Quaker &c) of modern liberty & modern change. God grant the
struggle may be bloodless & take its place by the side of your W. India
Experiment, worthy to stand betwixt Orion & the Pleiades for the world
to gaze at. [Repeats line about HCW]. ... When you think of all the
oppressions that are done under the sun from the Emperor Nicholas with
14 million serfs to the domestic in the outer room under an (equally?)
false social system, does it ever seem [to be] idle to attempt laboring
to leave the world better than we found it? [Follows the Webb paragraph
...] ... In the June No 1841 of “Metropolitan & Anti Corn Law Journal
which you long ago gave me there is a good letter signed ‘Sidney Smith
448 Strand.’ This is not the great Rev. Sidney of the Edinburg Rev. is
it? of course not then who is he then? C How many people in England have
a right to vote {u}1 in 100{/u}? or what proportion?”
