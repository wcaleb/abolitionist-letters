EPN to WP. {{u}BAA{/u} No. 131.}

“Dear Wendell what act of atrocity has {u}my{/u} friend – the Lion of
[Derrymane?] – been guilty of to call forth such a castigation from thy
pen? My brains were puzzled – I revlved & revolved in my mind what ever
it cd be & could pitch upon nothing but the American repeal money. Then
in that matter my opinion seems to coincide with his. The other day
however, I met with a lot of Letters in the ‘Standard’ from American
slaveholding repealers with Dan’s speeches in their receipt by the Irish
Assn, which I guess gave rise to thy ire, for truly they did to mine & I
longed for the first time in my life to give him a scold. He certainly
displayed any thing but a manly spirit in his comments on the
disgustingly hypocritical talk about Liberty, in the letter, I think,
from New Orleans. Instead of a [cutting?] rebuke, he moves the ‘marked
thanks’ of the meeting &c. And am I doomed to find {u}this{/u} Idol, to
be but {u}clay{/u}? alas! alas! ‘tis deeply humiliating. [{u}BAA{/u}
excerpt.]” **BAA No. 131.** Includes reports about disturbances and
distress in the country side. The famous paragraph where she mentions
the help she has given to the Chartists which means “I’ve a right to
expect protection—have I not?!!!” She says her fears would be less if
soldiers weren’t involved, but “they do but drive the populace to
greater desperation & deeds of violence.”
