Gibbons, James Sloan, to EPN. H.C. Wright. Seriousness of great world
social revolution in progress; expected death of Henry Chapman. Brief
paragraph in {u}BAA{/u}.

“I wish I had time to tell thee of the increasing concern & anxiety of
the serious & sober minded with us, relative to the great social
revolution now going on in the world. The deliberations of those who
undertake the solemn task of moving public sentiment to action, cannot
be too earnestly directed to this subject. Indications that the issue
approaches with accumulative speed & force, are perpetually multiplying
around us. But while we are made sensible of this, we must feel a
corresponding weight of obligation, to labor with all diligence & with
never faltering faith. Duty grows more imperative daily, the capacity to
do, keeps pace with it; and if we are only faithful, our effectiveness
increases in like proportion. [{u}BAA{/u} excerpt.]” **BAA No. 133.**
“These are times for great progress in social good—times for the
development of great principles. Common misery binds the suffering
labourers of Europe & America in sympathy with each other.”
