**[1842, 09-29] Ms.A.1.2.12.2.94**

EPN to WP; Feethams. {Bulk in **{u}BAA No. 134{/u}**.} After praising
Joseph Sturge, she regrets once again Colver’s influence on him, but
when they met recently they didn’t talk about this. Thanks WP for his
questions about Chartism—“they taught me how little I *really knew* on
the subject notwithstanding that I reckon myself one of their body—so
off I sent them to our friend Ashurst for replies.” He copied them to
“three of the leading Chartists.” Lovett, “a great man among *my
people*,” has written. She believes suffrage lies “at the very
foundation of the prosperity—almost of the existence—of this country.
Surely it is to class Legislation that nearly all the evils which affect
Gt. Britain & render her a curse, instead of a blessing, to other
nations—is to be attributed and so long as this hydra-headed monster is
suffered to remain, it is vain to strike off one of its heads—in the
shape of the Corn Laws, Monopoly, union of church & state or aught else
… Tis expecting too much of poor human nature, to anticipate that those
who have the power will legislate against their own interests—tho they
*might* have been a *little* more modest, than to rob the people …” She
thinks Sturge should have retained name Chartists: “why succumb to the
prejudices of the middle classes by rejecting an appellation which tells
you their principles at once.” But Sturge is being “bold & independent”
and “we must honour him for it.” She thinks most Chartists favor women’s
rights.

**[1842, 10-01] O’Connell Correspondence, \#2981a, 7:176-177**

James Haughton to O’Connell. “My dear lord mayor, … I know you hate
slavery; your whole life has been one continuous act of oppression to
the iniquity in all its forms. Now is the critical moment for Ireland.
We must either rise in the esteem or sink into the contempt of the good
and the free-hearted in America. I conjure you to put an end to the
unholy alliance between Irishmen and slave-dealers in America. You can
do more to effect this great good than any other living man. I need not
enlarge; my whole soul is with you in favour of human rights. I can in
truth say, I long to see your renown increased by a continued glorious
action to force their universal acknowledgement, but do not lose your
moral power (the only power which can enable you to gain your object) by
the acceptance of further sympathy or aid from American ‘soul-drivers’.
The work of your life will be marred and destroyed by such an unholy
contamination.”
