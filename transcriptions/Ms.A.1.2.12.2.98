Tappan, Lewis, to RDW; New York. Replying to a letter from Webb.

“The Missionary operations have been crowned with much success. The
missionaries have introduced written languages into various heathen
countries, have translated & spread very many copies of the Holy
Scriptures, and have been the agents of bringing many souls to Christ.
Still we must point out to them their errors & kindly & faithfully aim
to bring them up to consistent action. [p] I have in my possession
manuscript sermons that were written & preached in Ireland near the
close of the 17^th^ Century by my maternal ancestor, William [Homes?],
who was, I believe, an Irish Presbyterian Minister. He preached at
Straham & Londonderry. Do you see I have Irish blood in my veins.
Without this I should claim kindred to the noble hearted philanthropists
of your land.”
