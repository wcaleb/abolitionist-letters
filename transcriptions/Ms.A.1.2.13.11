“I very much enjoyed my journey here. My strength increased as I
advanced, and I was able to enter with zest into all the scenes that lay
in my way. Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Cairo, the Desert, the Red Sea,
[Aden?], Bombay, the Malabar Coast, the Island of [Ramiss??], Madras!!
Oh I could fill a book with descriptions of what I saw and felt thus
far. If I was not doing good I was every moment reaping pleasure, and
feasting my mind upon the ten thousand novel objects presented to my
eyes. On the fourth of January, at two in the afternoon, I could the
first view of the City of Palaces ... At three I landed with the Baboo,
and with him and a long train of carriages, crowded with his friends,
and a host of pedestrians, entered the city. I received a warm welcome
from all to whom I was introduced, both native & European. I have now
been seven weeks a sojourner here, and can only epitomize the history of
that period. I have been most kindly received by the Governor (acting
for Lord Ellenborough) and every other member of the Board, and have
[repeatedly?] been a guest at the Government houses. The Secretaries of
Government have invited me to their several departments, the Governor
has request me to ask for all papers, not prohibited by act of
Parliament. He took me soon after my landing to several interesting
examinations of Public Institutions, and says the country under his
control (the provinces of Bengal) is open to my inspection, with a
general introduction to all the Stations. All this without the abatement
of a jot or tittle of my radical principles, and with the full knowledge
of my unflinching opposition to the measure of Lendenhall Street. I have
not had [few?] vacant evenings since I landed. Dinners, suppers, musical
parties, & galas (given to Affghan & Chinese heroes (alias plunderers
and cut throats) have occupied my time after 7 P.M. I have gone wherever
I have been invited, as my object is to see every thing, and as far as
possible to know every body. But my chief companions have been the
natives. I have had a meeting with them, {u}every{/u} week. My party
averages about 230. These are those who understand English, and all of
them are shrewd & well educated and at the same time of the highest
class – Rajahs, Baboos, [Zemindors?], Merchants, & Public Officers &c.
My addresses, which have all been carefully preserved, are even going
through the press, both in English and [Bengalese? Bengallee?]. You
shall see them, and judge for yourself. I have lived {u}wholly{/u} in
the native town, and think I have won the confidence and affection of
the people, without in the least obstructing my progress in any other
direction. I have made several speeches at the Town Hall, which have
been much applauded by the Press. I am just forming a Native Society,
and have this morning taken a building in which to hold my meetings for
the future. I hope a right spirit is diffusing itself among the
intelligent natives. The total ignorance of the lower classes, of the
English language prevents me from addressing them, and indeed they are
without power, and at present without spirit believing that their fate
is written on their forehead, and that with {u}who{/u} rules, or
{u}how{/u}, they have nothing to do. [Plans to meet with the Raga of
Sattara. Working to revive a Landholders Society, made up of high-class
natives, through which to send memorials to Government.]
