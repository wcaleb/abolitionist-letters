Mott, Lucretia, to RDW and HW; Philadelphia. Introducing Henry Colman;
Anti-corn law agitations; probability of speedy success in Anti-Slavery
cause; home news.

“H.C. Wright seemed to find it hard work to leave you. His letters home,
as well as those in the Liberator have been read by us with great
interest. They took us to your drawing room & brought all your family
including the visitors into near communion with us. We were glad to hear
he is likely to do so well with his book. ... The Anti-Corn law
agitators really are in earnest. If they can only effect their object,
one great cause of the suffering & distress among you will be removed.
But many will remain, that ought to claim equal attention. How can any
benevolent heart & enlightened mind rest easy under your oppressive
tythe [sic] exactions? Then your enormous expenditures for the support
of Royalty! Why does not your cry wax louder & louder? Even as it has
done against the army & navy. There is certainly much to encourage the
reformer, in the growing public sentiment in favor of the right. Witness
the increasing dislike of capital punishment. This subject is claiming
attention in many parts of this country. Literary & debating societies
are taking it up for discussion, and petitions are presented to our
several Legislatures. [p] The probability of speedy success in our
efforts for human freedom, may be as apparent to you, in your abundant
access to our Anti-Slavery papers, as my prophetic vision can delineate
it. Before this will reach you, whatever of interest is occurring with
us, you will be made acquainted with.” [Retirement of LMC as editor of
the NASS. Asks what he thinks about the separation of the Indiana
Orthodox Friends.]
