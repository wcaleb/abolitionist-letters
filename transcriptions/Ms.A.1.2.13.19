[April 12] “You dear Henry, (as the children say) are in boring England.
I should delight to see it again & to see a few dear friends there.
{u}Elizzy Pease I would make a voyage to see. Dear, noble woman – I see
her tall figure & her heaven-blue eye. How we roamed about in that
London. You have seen her at her castle at Darlington. I have a dreamy
remembrance of it, its glades & lawns and glorious old oaks. Tell Lizzy
Pease I remember her just as I want her to remember me. Tell her there
is nobody within the four seas of Britain, that knows how to appreciate
her so well as I do{/u} & that I {u}do{/u} appreciate her to the extent
of my ability. That wife and I together {u}love{/u} her -- & that she
{u}must{/u} come over here & {u}pay us two{/u} a visit. Why it would
only be a fortnights jaunt. By the way, Henry C. Wright, dont you come
back without bringing E.P. with you. Remember that. Tell her she must
see {u}New{/u} England as well as {u}Old{/u}, before she will have seen
{u}all{/u} England. [p] You have seen Ireland, was it not a sight to
your eyes – The Webbs, & the Haughtons, the Allens, & the other Dublin
{u}heroes{/u} of both sexes. You have seen O’Connel [sic] too. Is he not
a chieftain. Did you ever see a creature of such power of the tongue. I
never saw any one who could converse with an audience, like him.
Speeches may be as well made by other men, but I never heard such
{u}public talk{/u} from any body. The creatures mind plays before ten
thousand, & his voice flows as clearly & as leisurely as in a circle
round a fire-side, and he has the advantage of the excitement it affords
to inflame his powers. [p] The consciousness of the presence of an
audience palsies me. I have not the use of any of my faculties there, --
but when O’Connell is speaking, I have no lack of {u}apprehension{/u} of
all he is saying, & my fancy sometimes outruns his, yet if I were
obliged to speak out, I should not have {u}any fancy{/u} left. I am
accounting for the {u}apparent difference{/u} between {u}distinguished
orators{/u}. [Mentions getting an organ in Concord and his playing the
fiddle. Wishes Webb & Pease could “hear us play Zip Coon!”] ... Now dear
Henry I dont know what more to say. Dear England, Ireland, Scotland, I
dream of you – Have I ever seen them. I often doubt it. I flashed over
and back like a comet and just touched the famous Islands. I should not
love certain ones there though, as I do, if I had not really seen them.”
