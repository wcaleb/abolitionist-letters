Mott, Lucretia, to RDW; Philadelphia. Introducing Edward N. Wright;
London convention.

“As the time draweth near for the London Convention, we think & talk a
great deal about our visit & shall imagine the gathering in the
‘gorgeous hall,’ with Joseph Sturge as full of business as he was 3
years since – only he will not have to keep women out. Thou wast
mistaken when thou wrote that they would not have J.C. Fuller to bother
them again, for he has gone & has probably arrived by this time. ...
With this I intend to send a letter I received lately from J.S. Gibbons
thinking it will be to thy taste. Our 9^th^ Annual Report I also send &
shall request Edward Wright to hand the parcel to Richard Allen or any
other who may be in London from your city at the Convention.”
