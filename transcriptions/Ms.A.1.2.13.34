[Talks about her deep sisterly affection for Garrison.] ... Dearest
Henry is staying with my father & self at the Guildhall Hotel, he was
the only attraction the ‘World’s Convention’ offered to me & with him to
talk to I enjoy it – tho’ as regards the {u}actors{/u} in the scene,
they are more like children playing at holding a Convention – with some
few exceptions. We flatter ourselves there is as much humanity & sense
behind the [rail?] as in front of it, & we further think we may do this
without being vry vain either. But Henry will write thee a [regular?]
detail. He sits in the corner reporting & is an object of wonder &
admiration to all who occupy the Negro pew & many within the precincts
of the Sacred Enclosure. They say ‘Why there’s more sense more
intelligence gentleness in his face than in any one in the [room?] – who
{u}can{/u} he be?’ We have had some [rich? sick?] exhibitions of
Sectarianism which I’ll send thee, if I can find time when this
‘representative of the World’s humanity’ as Phelps calls it, has
dissolved.”

Reports on his trip to the second “World’s Convention.” “The Anti
Slavery ‘Worlds Convention’ was the ditto of 1840, and was as much
ridden by a narrow, peddling, contracted spirit as its predecessor.” …
“I found a letter lying on the mantel piece from M. W. C. & another from
Thomas Davis, when I landed yesterday from Liverpool. Davis wants to
know my opinion of {u}the repale{/u}. Firstly, I would advise him to
believe nothing he sees in any of the papers in the way of comment upon
facts. Secondly, I think that while O’Connell’s influence was on the
wane with the people during the last ten years until within 6 months,
since that time it has increased to a greater extent than it ever
attained before—and now he is {u}the man of the people.{/u} I have no
confidence in his moral integrity on any great question, but of the
readiness of his instincts and the vastness of his power there can be no
second opinion, and he wields all his strength with the skill and
unscrupulousness of a first rate lawyer. I don’t think him a man of much
physical courage, but his moral daring {u}appears{/u} great, for he is
so skilled in the law that he knows how to keep himself & such of his
followers as will be guided by him, strictly outside its [meshes?]. I
should think that Repeal is the darling object of the hearts of 7/8ths
of the Irish people—more from a very natural & intense hatred to England
than from any precise or enlightened idea of the benefits it is likely
to confer. It is a passionate movement, prompted by fierce nationality,
hatred, & revenge. They think they cannot be worse off as an independent
nation connected with the English crown than they now are as a mere
English country. The acts of government in dismissing magistrates for
attending repeal meetings, and in sending over some 20 or 30,000 troops
by way of keeping down the movement, have accelerated it prodigiously.
Meetings of 100, 200, 300 thousand people have been held with the most
perfect order and with great enthusiasm in various parts of the country.
I don’t think the people would at all dislike the idea of {u}a
row{/u}—nor would the government, for the sake of having a good
opportunity and apology for putting them effectually down. But the
temperance reform has made Paddy much more amenable to his spiritual and
political guides—and the priests & O’Connell have both sense enough to
know that if they succeed it must be by the agitation of words & by
acting on the fears and the apprehensions of government, and not by
sharp weapons & thundering guns. I don’t think the repeal movement will
die away, or end in nothing. It will come to a substantial conclusion
some time or other, but when, or how, or wherefore, is more than I can
prophesy or even imagine. I don’t think any distinct apprehension of
constitutional liberty exists amongst {u}the mass{/u} of the repealers.
To put popery up and England down would be the fulfillment of their
dearest wishes. The Pope and his priests wield more real power in
Ireland than in any other European country. … Other priests are bad
enough, but as a general rule, the Romish hierarchy is the most terrible
of all.” More comments on O’Connell’s untrustworthiness, because he’s a
politician.

RDW to MWC; Dublin.

“This day (the 3^rd^ of July) there is to be a great {u}repeal
demonstration{/u} on Donnybrook Green near Dublin. O’Connell will be
there & a huge multitude, perhaps hundreds of thousands. The Temperance
Bands are banging away now as they march there. This movement has no
moral dignity to arrest the attention of the Philanthropist, the Patriot
or the Christian. It is natural enough & from the course of the last 100
years history, almost inevitable but there is nothing high souled or
heart warming to him who would look on the world as his home & all men
as brothers. Our rulers are corrupt, proud, overbearing, and our people
as far as I can judge them have been so badly taught that if they had
the power they would be no better. I take no part in politics, and in
theory & talk am more of a repealer and a radical than anything else –
but what good comes of mere politics & mere politicians? They have
nothing to do with principle whatever.”
