WP to EPN; Boston.

[Informs her that JAC has been “swallowed up in his crazy property
views,” and a rift developed involving him, Remond, Bradburn and
Douglass on the Western tour.] ... “I consider Darlington as little more
than an afternoon’s ride now from Boston. ... Do tell me whether this
recent emancipation in India amounts to any thing. ‘Twas delightful Geo.
Thompson should be there when it took place. But will it be effectual?
Or is it a sham? is your father satisfied with it? Will there be any
body on the spot to see it carried into effect? Tell me all about it
when you’re able. ... I have thought of a way of getting you over here.
We’ll get the Broad Street people to have a Worlds Conv, at New York,
then you & Webb must come just to show that there are some good English
people not new organized & we shall expect you & him to fight the woman
question here as we did in London. Each country must have one example.”
