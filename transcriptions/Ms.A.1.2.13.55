NPR to Francis Jackson; Concord. Daniel O’Connell’s treatment of
Garrison. All societies should protest.

“Old Daniel O’Connell – what is the agitator after Garrison so [far?] –
I dont understand it – I have given him as you see what little [poking?]
I had strength to. I dont know what could induce him to treat Garrison
{u}just{/u} in the way he has – I could account for a hundred other
kinds of conduct, easier than for this. It will gratify new
organization, if the ill treatment is not too gross for their stomachs.
It will please the {u}Protestant{/u} clergy. ... Poor Garrison, his stay
at Northampton may have to be prolonged [by?] inconvenient [?] by his
wife’s disaster – and amid all his domestic troubles, to be assaulted by
the world’s agitator, & to have nobody but me to take up his defence! –
The [charm?] of it is he needs no defence – if he did I would not hazard
his amply being [?] to plead it. I wish [?] would give O’Connell a
castigation. ... How would it do for the Mass. Society to pass a resolve
or two & send them to Ireland to the Freeman’s Journal. The colored
People of Boston might so speak out. The National Society ought to. The
Boston Female Society ought as ought all of them to let it pass. I
hardly know what is good judgment. I was indignant & could not wait to
think.”
