NPR to WLG; Concord. Glad they agree on indignation at O’Connell’s
treatment of him, and that Herald article was satisfactory. Anti-slavery
affairs.

“I have repeated the dose this week, giving some particulars, as the
late visit at Pall Mall with Thompson & the interviews at Freemason Hall
lobby & at R.D. Webbs in Dublin. I have also sketched the Great Agitator
at his {u}devotions{/u} at Elizy Pease’s dinner, of which you have heard
me speak. I have done with O’Connell as a philanthropist. His meanness
in these assaults is unpardonable & betrays what Richard Webb says is
true of him, that he has no moral integrity. I thought it might be well
to back up what Amasa Walker says of his bigotry, with a picture of him
before he took his wine & dinner, at his holy metamorphosis.”
