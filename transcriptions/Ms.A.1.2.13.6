“HC Wright is, I suppose at Manchester this week, at the grant Anti Corn
Law gathering. When it is over he purposes coming to Darlington. I have
not yet seen him, the Irish friends to freedom & free trade, having
wholly monopolized him since he arrived in our shores. He has brought
out a very neat edition of his admirable little book, admirable it is, &
calculated to be of immense use to the rising generation, & to the
{u}risen{/u} generation too, if they’d only learn its blessed
principles. ... What think you of Lord Morpeth’s letter to Mrs [C?]. It
is [going] the rounds of the papers here. My father dont like it at all.
He thinks it {u}hollow{/u}. I regret his idea about foreign
interference. Still, after the way he acted when in the U.S. I can
hardly set him down as insincere, notwithstanding he acted {u}very
badly{/u} during {u}our{/u} struggle in 1838, but then he was in
fetters. Still, that’s not a sufficient excuse for violating principle.”

RDW to MWC; Dublin. {Some in {u}BAA{/u}, but the whole first half
unpublished}

“I got a corner of Henry C. Wright’s sheet to Garrison, and I wrote him
a letter that it will take {u}a four-Wendell-Phillips-power{/u} to
decypher. I did not write it badly on purpose, oh no, but simply in my
own {u}natural{/u} style of writing, which in all the Free States, among
all the abolitionists, is every where spoken against. ... This was
neither more or less than a message to thyself about a matter that will
I suppose seem very small to make such a fuss about, the O’Connell
manuscript. In the almost year which has elapsed since its departure for
your shores two very anxious messages have been sent to me by
O’Connell’s secretary for that manuscript, which I sent away empty by
saying first that O’Connell had given it to me himself – which he did
and secondly, that it was gone to America. Now I have little doubt that
if the great man were dead it would be looked on as quite a prize, and
therefore if it be not sold I would be obliged by they keeping it over
for a good market, either with you or in Ireland. Being a tradesman I
have of course a keen eye to the money and I would be glad to squeeze as
much out of nothing as possible. As to myself I am not an autograph
collector in the peoples sense of the word. Whatever I get, I give away
and I have no collection of any kind except (now, you should all rise
up, and make me a profound bow) except a few letters from American
Abolitionists, who were the gods of my idolatry a year, or two, or three
ago. Now, alas! I find – and I am glad of the discovery – that they are
only very delightful, trusty, and well beloved men and women.
O’Connell’s health has been somewhat alarmingly bad lately, so that when
he appeared at the Theatre a few days ago, before a large audience, the
Duke of Leicester in the chair, and a great many noblemen & such small
deer around him to take part in the proceedings of a meeting assembled
to devise a testimonial to Father Mathew, there arose such a burst of
popular welcome, such a real Irish welcome from the galleries and the
pit, but not from the boxes – as would have frightened all thy Boston
blood from its propriety. O’Connell is not a great man in thy meaning.
He is a big man, with a big head, vast skill and Demosthenian ability.
He blarneyed and tickled the people on the occasion with consummate
adroitness and {u}unfairness{/u}. He is no teetotaller – he never took
the pledge – but he has allowed it to be supposed that he was one – and
during this time he drank wine in public to the great scandal of those
who really loved him and to the delight of the anti teetotallers which
includes most of the well dressed high church and high state people in
Ireland. Henry Wright thought James Haughton’s speech was the only one
he heard at that meeting which had heart and consistency in it. As to
ability and [?] of course O’Connells was preeminent, but it was a taste
in the mouth – it left no strength – no {u}body{/u} – behind it. His
heart is not, and I fear never was in the movement. {u}It{/u} is headed
by another and a very different man, whose influence is in some degree
antagonist to his own. Father Mathew is no active politician, and he is
ever recommending repose from agitation. I believe him to be a truly
honest man, as far as a man who is a priest can be honest. But
undoubtedly he is not much of a Mrs. Chapman. The meeting was a crowded
and very large assembly – it consisted of people of all classes and
parties and sects and sexes, and yet the feeling of respect and
gratitude was unanimous towards the noble hearted and pure handed moral
regenerates of our country. Another thing – all idea of a statue or a
‘Bunker hill’ monument to commemorate him, was discarded as unworthy of
the man and of the occasion, and it was resolved that whatever be
decided one shall be something of a nationally useful and beneficent
character. The selection is left to a Committee who shall choose from
all the plans they approve of, two or three, which are to be presented
to Father Mathew to decide which he would prefer. [p] I heard thy letter
to Lord Morpeth read a few evenings ago, no I meant, Lord Morpeths
letter to thee. It {u}read{/u} very well, and is quite as good as I
would expect from him. There is a favorite grand idea of thine which I
feel but cant put into words, about all genuine moral enterprises being
like chain balls – when one goes the other, is sure to effect a
[lodgement?]. Temperance – Anti Slavery – Peace Principles have thus
made way for one another. This is an excellent idea, but it holds good
to my mind the other way – this {u}notion{/u} of the chain-balls. I hope
for little honestly good or great from the man who formed an important
member of that British cabinet which gave the national sanction to the
horribly mean, wicked, cruel, and brigand-like Affghan [sic] & Chinese
invasions. I dont think all Rogers’s sparkling, pure and bright New
Hampshire highland streams would wash Lord Morpeth’s hands and heart
clean of the infamy they contracted then. Lord Morpeth is no longer a
man – he is a politician, with his eye to the Eden from which he is shut
out, the [?] of Downing Street and Secretary Ships. I think that the
letter he wrote for the Liberty Bell and all his acts in America had a
reference to his political standing rather than to his heart’s
convictions. I dont doubt but he is one of the best of his class, but
all such men, all active politicians do very unworthy and wicked things
and you can never depend on them or on their honesty whenever a chance
remains of restoration to the heights of command. What does he mean of
his compliments to Slaveholders – as to their [merits?] – their piety –
their worth? – Why dont they show the [point?] of all their virtues by
trying to humanise and {u}liberate{/u} the whites – and freeing their
own bondsmen? Why dont they do as they would be done by? What he says is
very true – that you yourselves must do the work. It is little that any
other country and people can do for you. Yet why try and extinguish the
sympathy that is felt in some few hearts in these islands for your noble
labours – by persuading us that we can do {u}nothing{/u} for you? I am
not sorry he wrote the letter and that you published it. I dont know
what you think of it. But I hope you now know what is the help you can
expect from one of the best lords in England. ... It is only just now
... that a newspaper has come to me from Manchester full of talk about
the league – and it is enough to sicken me to see all the fuss the
leaguers make about the peers that are coming and the peers that regret
they cannot come – and those who decline to come, &c.” BAA: Enjoyed
Phillips’s Chartist speech, but he doesn’t have great hopes for the
movement.
