GT to RDW; Delhi.

[Thompson has just had a fever, and is afflicted with something like
dysentery.] “I feel no less bound, without delay, to notice the manner
in which you have alluded to my Connection with the King of Delhi. True,
at his invitation & most earnest request, I have come hither to render
him my advice, & if possible some assistance; but, you do me injustice
if you suppose that I have therefore given up the cause of the people at
large, or impaired my ability to serve them. So far from it, I deem
myself in every respect in the [?] of my duty. I am seeing some of the
most interesting parts of the country, I am gaining a greater insight
into native Character than I could otherwise hope to do. I am learning
the manners & customs of native courts. I am gaining much important
information respecting the conduct of the British Government towards the
imperial family of Delhi, and I am at the same time (I hope and believe)
espousing, if not forwarding, the cause [?] and good faith; and all
without neglecting the object of my visit to this country. Do not my
dear friend indulge in any hurtful surmises respecting me. I care little
for the calumnies of Enemies, but feel deeply any thing like a suspicion
on the part of a friend. I can truly say that the conviction of my mind
was (and is) that the causes of the Hindoo nation wd be promoted as far
as I am concerned by my coming here, and being Employed, if there was a
necessity, in behalf of the king in England. ... I am in the midst of
the most Celebrated ruins of this Country. The dust of Empires forms the
soil. I have explored much of the neighbourhood, read and reread the
various histories of the [Mussulman?] tale in India – been over palaces,
forts, temples, mosques, gardens, & tombs, & learnt many a lesson which
can only be learnt by visiting the actual scenes where some of the
[greatest?] events have occurred. ... As the mind & counsellor of the
King I have had the confidence and respect of the natives, and have been
admitted to their [?] to an extent that wd not have been allowed under
any other circumstances. In all my intercourse I have endeavoured to
disseminate sound principles, and to excite them to such a course of
conduct as would be for their own & their country’s good. [p] Things are
very different here from Calcutta. In the latter place Education has
made Considerable progress, and there are hundreds that can appreciate a
discourse delivered in English, upon a subject connected with the cause
of improvements. Here things are as they have been for Centuries.
Scarcely any inroad has been made upon the ignorance and prejudice of
the people. They are naturally gifted with average [powers?], and in
diplomacy and the ordinary affairs of life exhibit extraordinary
subtlety and talent, but their propensities, principles & actions are
purely Asiatic, & it is next to impossible to get them to conceive even
the meaning of those ideas and principles which form the standard of men
of sound Christian Education. I speak of the Hindoo & [Mussulman?]
population both, for there is no marked or essential difference between
them in any thing that respects their conduct towards their fellowmen. I
could scarcely have been placed in a position for gaining a more
accurate knowledge of the habits & feelings of the natives of the
interior of India. [Expects to leave for Suez on Dec 14, headed home.]
