McKim to RDW; Philadelphia. Would like files of Irish papers for a
reading room; interest in their repeal movement as well as anti-slavery
cause; quotations of Thomas Earle’s explanation of “exact position of
slavery in its relation to the constitution and laws of the federal and
national government of the U.S.”; volumes to go to Mr O’Connell.

“From what I have heard & seen of your character, you will excuse I am
sure, without an apology, the liberty I am about to take with you. You
must know that we here in Phil^a^ take a very deep & special interest in
your Repeal movements & more particularly in such of them as have a
bearing upon the Anti-Slavery question. Consequently we look for the
arrival by every steamer of Irish papers with much eagerness, & what few
we get are read with much avidity. Now what I have to ask, is that you
will for the cause sake – both of Repeal & Abolition – take measures to
have us supplied with regular files some of your most important Irish
Journals. Attached to our office is a Reading Room which is resorted to
daily by our anti-slavery friends, & recently since we have been
receiving occasional Irish papers by a good many of our pro-Slavery
Irish friends. The visits of [their?] class would be much increased if
we had regular files of your papers, & the anti-slavery interest wd
certainly [?] be indirectly promoted. Any evidence such as this wd be of
sympathy & correspondence between us & the Dublin Repealers is
calculated [to] increase the hold which we are of late beginning to have
on the confidence of the Irish population of this city. O’Connell’s
speeches have been doing {u}immeasurable{/u} good for our cause. He is
almost as much of an ‘Agitator’ in America, as he is in his own country.
As fast as his speeches come out we publish them here in our daily
papers (paying for their insertion) in pamphlet form & scatter them
broad-cast over the land. I hope he will go on as he has begun, & keep
castigating our democratic inconsistency & republican hypocrisy until
for very shame sake we are driven to put away from us the evil of our
doings. ... I believe we have had a promise, thro’ our delegates to the
‘World Convention, of some contributions to our cause which have not yet
I believe been forth-coming, and besides, I have been in the practice of
mailing the Pa. Freeman regularly for about 3 years to yourself & others
in Ireland; to say nothing of the [?] of political & miscellaneous
papers which I sent off to you this summer, & for which I believe my
very worthy & particular friend Ed. M. Davis got the credit. [Offers
this as a justification for his request, and asks for the papers to be
sent to him at the Pa Freedman office.] [p] We have been talking of
sending [over?] to Mr O’Connell & have procured for that purpose books
which will show to him as a lawyer & statesman the exact position of
slavery in its relation to the constitution & laws of the Federal &
state governments of the U.S. His views & the views of some of his
correspondents seem to be obscure on this subject. Thos Earle, knowing
that I was about to write to him, requested that I wd say something to
correct the mistakes which people on your side of the water are likely
to fall into upon this subject. On asking him to tell me particularly
what he wanted me to say, he wrote off the following, which I copy:

‘ There appears, in the letters written from some of the Repealers in
this country, either a misapprehension as to the power to abolish
slavery or a disposition to lead others into such misapprehension. The
Constitution is constantly appealed to as an argument why nothing should
be done for the cause of abolition, and the evidence of the writers in
what are called the non-slaveholding is referred to as a reason for
their having nothing to do with the matter. The reference to the
Constitution seems to have somewhat embarrassed Mr O’Connell, who
probably not having a copy of that instrument, could not know precisely
what answer to give to it. We wd therefore state that our national
constitution is, like any other law, alterable by the will of the
people, and that itself points out the mode of making the alteration.
... Again, the idea seems to be held out that our slaveholding states
cannot by their own act, abolish Slavery in their own limits by reason
of something in the Constitution of the National Govt which prevents it.
This idea is utterly destitute even of plausibility. ...’

This statement of the case by Mr Earle, if read by Mr O’Connell, will
disabuse his mind, I think of any wrong impressions which may have been
produced by the letters of his anti-abolition correspondents in this
country. Will you not please, if you agree with us in thinking it worth
the while, to put a copy of the forgoing extract in Mr O’Connell’s hands
for perusal? [p] One of the books we talked of sending to Mr O’Connell,
is a volume containing the Constitution of the United States, & of each
of the particular states. If practicable I will send it by the steamer
that will carry this letter, & to your care. We had intended to send
also the laws of one or more of our Slaveholding States, but found them
too voluminous to be convenient. In the volume of ‘Constitutions,’ I wd
refer Mr O’Connell to p. 131 [13?] Section 2d Clause 3^rd^ for proof of
the National participation in slaveholding. The circumlocution of the
sentence marked on p. 5 is to avoid the use of the word ‘slaves’. This
clause offers a bounty to slaveholders by giving them a representative
of their property. Page 13. Section 4^th^ for ‘domestic violence’ read
{u}slave{/u} insurrection. The former was chosen doubtless because
sounds less odious. in same page under the head ‘amendments’ will be
found the mode of altering the constitution & on page 15 [the? ten?]
amendments made since the original adoption of the instrument. These are
a few of the many points worthy of notice. I have pointed them out at
random. Mr O’Connell will be clear-sighted enough to take note a great
many more. I might have mentioned the clause on page 8 at the bottom,
giving Congress {u}exclusive jurisdiction{/u} over the District of
Columbia, our ten miles square of national domain, where our nation has
its capital, & the slave trade its {u}head-quarters{/u}. For some
particulars of this trade see a letter of mine in an accompanying No. of
the Freeman. In the Constitutions of the Individual states will be found
the political doctrine of this country (as part of [?] constitutions)
that the people have a right at all times to alter their political
institutions, which of course embraces the {u}institution{/u} of
Slavery, and so much of the U.S. constitution as sanctions or sustains
that ‘institution.’ [p] I send also out of my own little library
‘[Strouds?] Sketch of the Slave Laws,’ which I must ask you to present
to Mr O’Connell as a slight token of my admiration of his course &
character & with the hope that it will be of use to him in the efforts
which I have no doubt he will continue to make in the cause of universal
emancipation. It is a rare & to us an exceedingly valuable book. ...
Most glad should I be to receive an occasional letter from you giving us
intelligence [of the?] workings of Repeal & anti Slavery in Ireland.”
