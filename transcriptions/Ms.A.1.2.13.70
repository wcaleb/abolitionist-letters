Hayden, Harriet W., to WLG; New York. Her belief in the Universal
family; bigotry in city with regard to Irish; Negroes, Irish and women
considered but links in animal chain by many; her attendance at Friend’s
meeting; love of liberty.

“I experience a thrill of pleasure in the reflection that all the
various customs, dialects, and complexions on earth belong to one
people, one great family, and that whatever blessings are experience by
one party, must in some measure and at some time extend to all. The glow
of patriotic pride I used to fell on account of our inventions and
discoveries in art & science our system of general education {u}and{/u}
our national enterprise have given place to the purer and higher joy
that all these things are tending to elevate the human race to improve
and bless vast regions of mind now laying waste and to bring together as
one household [band? land?] the various and distant tribes of earth. [p]
Oh! would to Heaven I could annihilate the cruel prejudice against the
Irish that exists in the minds of many in this city! It is as deep and
bitter in its hate and as hellish in its narrowness and proscription as
is the general prejudice against color. ... How many of the ‘lords of
creation’ seem to think that negroes Irish & women are together but
links in the animal chain. When I am with abolitionists of the old
organization I can breathe freely as one of the human species should
do.” [Write back to the Anti-Slavery office at Nassau.]
