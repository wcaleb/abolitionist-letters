Randall, Marenda B., to RDW; Woodstock. Belief in Brotherhood of Man and
importance of Physiological Reform; her own cure by Graham system.
Apparently Webb had written her about an article she put in the Vermont
Telegraph, inquiring whether her ideas about physiological reform had
had wide effectiveness.

“Transatlantic Brother, ... I am at once surprised and gratified to find
the influence of my feeble production has been felt beyond the limits of
my native land. It causes me to realize more than before that {u}man{/u}
wherever found is the brother of every other man in the vast universe.
Physiological Reform is a subject of great importance to my mind, so
much so that I cannot refuse to speak or write of its merits when there
is the least hope of thereby do [sic] good to the great Brotherhood of
man. ... I send you with this letter the last number of the Telegraph
containing the prospectus of {u}our{/u} paper, I say {u}our{/u}
{u}paper{/u} because it is the only one in the world which promises to
be open and free for every Brother and Sister of the great family. I am
personally acquainted with all the conductors of this paper and can
recommend them as worthy the patronage of a truthloving community. I
have been earnestly solicited by valued friends who have seen your
letter to answer it through the ‘Herald of Freedom’ that others who have
read my former letter which they kindly copied from the Telegraph may
also see this [but I leave it to your discretion].
