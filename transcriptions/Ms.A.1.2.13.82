{Contents of a Bazaar box, which included 3 copies of Beaumont’s
Ireland, “an admirable book, and translated by one of the most eminent
literary hacks of the day, an Irishman too. ... I think this one of the
very best books upon Ireland for any one who wishes to have a clear and
well drawn picture of her history and present position.” Laments the
resignation of Lydia Maria Child from the NASS but is not surprised.}
... “About O’Connell I have often said as thou hast done that I thought
him as honest as [an actor?] a politician could be – and I still think
so. This to be sure, after all, would be thought faint praise by one who
looked upon political life as so corrupting in its influences upon the
morals & the feelings of a man, as we do. My remarks upon him in my
letters to you were intended to show what I think of the man as a man –
suppose in comparison with Garrison or Rogers – not as a politician or
in any other qualifying sense. Since these State Prosecutions have
commenced, all my feelings as an Irishman (for I am one of that race of
white niggers) have been roused in his favor. Whatever his faults be and
they are many, I dont like to see this leader of the Catholic millions
badgered by the vinegar faced Attorney General of a vindictive English
Tory Ministry whom he has always baffled hither to, and I hope will
baffle again. One of the conspirators now on trial with O’Connell met me
the day before yesterday in the streets. I asked him how they fared and
what hope they had. He said ‘we hope to beat them yet.’ O’Connell being
a first rate lawyer and having some of the ablest men at the bar on his
side is of course enabled to do much to annoy, postpone, and baffled the
crown lawyer which could not be done in ordinary cases. Some weeks since
I wrote to H. Martineau (for the first time in my life, asking for a
contribution to the Liberty Bell and pouring forth into her sympathizing
(!) ear my regrets & patriotic horror at the Government prosecutions. I
wrote at some length, my thoughts suggested by the occasion. She replied
courteously that she had sent her contribution to the Liberty Bell to
Mrs. Chapman long since, and as to the military occupation of Ireland,
the Proclaiming down the Clontarf Repeal Meeting, and the State
Prosecution, she thought the conduct of the government so eminently
dignified, wise, & humane, that she gloried in it. She thinks O’Connell
one of the basest and worst of men for having done what he could to
encite [sic] hatred between the English & Irish, & has the fullest
confidence in the disposition and intention of government to do kindly
and justly towards Ireland in the way of [inquiring?] into grievances &
the reform of abuses. Mind now, this is the very same set of men who
when in opposition to the Whigs lately in power, used their best efforts
and successfully to counteract almost all that was attempted to be done
by them for the good of Ireland. They endeavoured almost successfully to
limit the franchise, and they damaged all the measures of reform they
did not destroy – They did all this, and Sir Robert Peel at the head of
them. Now why can Miss Martineau hope for justice, humanity and kindness
to Ireland, except on their own private professions to herself, I cannot
tell. I wrote in reply much of what I have now said, and reminded her
that as to O’Connells wickedness much might be said but that he had
sinned in words? Whilst both the English Whigs and Tories all the late
and all the [?] ministry, had been the red handed, black hearted
perpetrators of some of the meanest, cruellest [sic], least justifiable
wars in the whole history of the world. I allude to those in the east.
That unless we confine our ideas of mens moral obligations within
geographical boundaries, then men from whom she appeared to hope so much
for Ireland, are some of the most flagitious beings the world has seen,
and altogether unlikely to do a good thing in the right way from a good
motive. And at any rate if they do good to Ireland, we have O’Connell to
thank, & not them. She replied that she was not [able for?] controversy,
but that she remains of the same mind about O’Connell – that she hoped
for measures of such good for Ireland from the government, that she
united in my abhorrence of aristocratic aggression and of the eastern
wars which she called the crowning disgrace of the Whig ministry, tho’
they were equally disgraceful to the tories who carried them on to a
bloody & rapacious conclusion. Her last letter as well as her first was
full and courteous, more so than could have been looked for in reply to
such tirades from an obscure body like myself to one so distinguished as
she is. Nevertheless, I do not comprehend the grounds of her hopes of
sincere and large efforts for the good of Ireland from men who have
always acted against her, at least against her Catholic population which
includes five sixths of the people. For a true book about Ireland, free
from national, party, or religious bias, I would recommend De Beaumont.
[He is? As?] a Frenchman and a litterateur he is not likely to be much
of a devotee. A true idea of the hopes (in my mind, the vain hopes) of
the more ardent and intellectual of the Irish leaders – the young men –
Young Ireland – may be found in the {u}Spirit of the Nation{/u} a
collection of songs that I sent to Rogers lately. Part 2 is just
published. They are abundantly full of vengeance, bloodthirstiness, and
high flying [entreated?] nationality. This class has always to my
knowledge been anxious to purchase American support by silence on the
subject of Slavery, and O’Connell’s abolitionism has given them great
dissatisfaction. He is the only active repealer I know who has evinced
any [water spot on paper; two words covered] antislavery spirit. As to
the multitude they will swear to any thing [water spot] says, as
multitudes mostly do, specially such an impulsive [spot] subject
[people?] as ours. I doubt whether a very thin skinned, scrupulous
[spot] could be the leader of any mob. They would not understand him. I
attribute O’Connell’s fidelity in the long run to the Anti Slavery cause
– 1^st^ to his real respect to James Haughton – {u}next{/u}, to James
faithfulness in remonstrating with him, in rubbing the tin against the
grain, and perhaps to a sense of how seriously his character would
suffer by any course but the right one. [p] There is a copy of Beaumont
directed for Thomas Davis [in the Bazaar box]. ...”
