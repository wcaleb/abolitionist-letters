“Your Morning Chronicle is also recd and I am much obliged to you for
it. The account of the meeting of the League is deeply interesting & is
especially so to me after having become personally acquainted with
Cobden Bright & others concerned in that glorious movement. God speed
the Repeal of the Corn Laws, & God speed another ‘Repeal’ in which dear
Ireland is much interested. I do long to see those grand movements
consummated. It will be so auspicious to the great interests of humanity
on both sides of the Atlantic. Go ahead, push hard, & never tire, and if
their [sic] be any sympathy or assistance which we can yield you shall
have it cheerfully. --- We are going on with all our [grand? great?]
movements. Last week I attended one of the Conventions on the
Reorganization of Society. This is getting to be an important affair in
this country & is calling forth much attention. [But he is not yet sure
of the propriety and practicability of the movement.] ... The Temperance
cause is going forward steadily & successfully. ... The Old Organization
Antislavery society has had its Christmas Fair & as you will see, & have
been well patronized. They are the ‘True Blues’ no mistake. I was very
happy to see you in the Liberty Bell & also Doctor Bowring. ... The
Peace Cause is I am sure advancing. ... I am to go on to Washington as
one of a Committee of the Am. P. Socy to hold a public meeting there &
present our memorial (adopted at the London Convention) to the
President.”
