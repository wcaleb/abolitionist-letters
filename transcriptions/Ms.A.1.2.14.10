EPN to WP; Darlington.

“You will hear of the ‘State Trials,’ which form the leading topic of
public interest just now, so much better thro’ the papers, that {u}I
will{/u} not squander my space in saying much about them. The Injustice
of trying O’Connell by a Protestant July, will work well in the end, as
all such palpable outrages on the right do. Dan stands in a sublime
position right now, & if he & the people of Ireland continue firm in
their adherence to moral measures only, the result must be vastly for
the good of mankind. But what inconsistencies do we see even in great
men! Was there ever a more glaring one, than his treatment of W.L.G. I
felt it hard to forgive him for this.” I shall forward several Irish
papers, (the ‘Nation,’ the best repeal paper) by request of R.D.W. to
M.W.C. Thou canst get the loan of them, before they are sent to J. M.
McKim. [Asks about JAC, whose near infidelity she has heard scattered
rumors about from J.C. Fuller.]
