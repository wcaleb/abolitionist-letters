John Lord to [someone in Dublin, probably RDW]; Sheffield, Mechanic’s
Institute. Account of activities since leaving Dublin; attendance at his
lectures, etc.; Daniel O’Connell’s trial.

“I have read the trials with great interest. Sheils speech I admire,
tho’ it seemed a made up affair, and rather flowery. His peroration,
however, impresses me as being as eloquent as anything I ever read. I am
delighted with old Dan’s defence. – So clear – so unaffected – so simple
– so witty, so instructive, so persuasive, and so dignified. What an
everlasting disgrace the government will entail upon itself if it
convicts that man. He reminds me of Luther at the diet of Worms. If his
judges get immortality, it will be infamous, and obtained as King
Agrippa’s was, by being the judge of Paul. I do not believe even the
Irish are disposed to do justice to the great agitator – Moses was a
disorganiser, but he led the people out of Egypt. [p] But I do not wish
to fill this note with an out of place panegyric of O’Connell.” [In the
margin: If you have time will you send a line about the trials?]
