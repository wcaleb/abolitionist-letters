“Everything goes on in a [?] style in the political world now. The chief
speculations are about the probable fate of the conspirators & the
question is whether government will think it prudent to call them up for
judgment or not. I am satisfied that no outbreak of violence would
result from it on the part of the people, who have a will for {u}a
row{/u} strong enough upon them but they have no way. Their leaders know
that there could be no worse policy than to countenance any thing of the
kind. But although physically speaking it would be perfectly safe to
imprison O’Connell & his [comperes?], I am sure I would be a most
imprudent move for the Tories (or rather, for Peel) to take. It would
imbitter the minds of the Irish much against him & them. It would be in
manifest opposition to the [enthusiastically] expressed opinion of the
English people in London, Manchester, Liverpool, & other great towns,
and also of the Whig leaders who have condemned in the most printed
matter the manner in which the trial was conducted & the conviction
obtained. It would damage their character and point them out as
deficient in magnanimity & deficient in that love of fair play which is
the pride of Englishmen whether they are entitled to boast of it or not.
I hope they wont imprison O’Connell. I am not one of his worshippers by
any means. If he be a sun in your eyes, I am nearer to him than you are
& can see the spots. No man is a great man in the eyes of his valet.
Nevertheless I cant help being sorry when I read of Napoleon defeated. I
hate great reverses. I cant help feeling for the ruined [gamester?] I
hope they wont be so base & so cruel as to cage Dan. Richard Allen when
he was a philanthropic contributor to newspapers was amazingly addicted
to malaprops metaphors of the most ludicrous kind – he called George
Thompson on one occasion as the great Scottish Anti Slavery lion. Why
not called O’Connell our great Irish Anti Slavery Lion. ... [List of
subscribers to papers.] ... As to Father Mathew, you have not much to
hope for from him. He is a priest and will after all be led by priestly
influence. He is a fine fellow with many uncommon qualities, a fine
spirit & full of the milk of human kindness but he is not always above
board. He likes a bit of manoeuvreing. He is not always outspoken, in
that he is not likely to stick by any cause so unpopular as abolition in
New England. As to any harmony or common cause between the Catholics and
Unitarians or heterodox of any sort be assured that as far as the
Catholic Priests and such of the Catholics (the majority of them) as are
led by the Priests, the truce would prove a hollow one. ... As far as
the next world is concerned there is not much to choose between Romish
bigotry and that of the orthodox Protestant sects. But in this present
world which is all I have much personal knowledge of, I would certainly
much rather live in any Protestant country than amongst Catholics where
the priests had political power and unrestrained influence. [Speaks of
the return of his cousin Joseph Poole from Grafenberg, where he saw
H.C.W.] ... All Henrys letters latterly have been much more hopeful and
cheerful. He gives a better account of himself, he walks a great deal in
very severe weather. ... Besides he is kept in life by the acquisition
of acquaintances with whom he wrangles by the hour about peace and
nonresistance and all that sort of thing. An old Polish Gentleman ...
has been half converted by him, and has wholly and really invited him to
pay him a visit in Warsaw, only three or four days journey from
Grafenberg. They have plenty of Russians at Gr. and some of them queer
specimens of humanity.” [Mention of forwarding Frederika Bremer’s parcel
to someone.]
