[Still holds Elizur Wright in high regard, even though he knows that
makes him less orthodox with the Clique. Wright was the first
abolitionist to write him. “G.T. (when he bit me with that American Anti
Slavery mania which has never left me)” recommended that he write to
Wright, and received a “civil answer.”] ... Though they may be bigotted,
envious, jealous, or even malignant, I cannot {u}feel{/u} such men as
Phelps, Leavitt, Whittier, Weld, & the like to be the {u}worst{/u}
enemies of the slave (as we are commanded) however conscious I am of the
evil influence of their course in the slave’s cause. ... [Body in
{u}BAA{/u}: He opposes the repeal of the sugar duties.] ... [Dined
yesterday at James Houghton’s with Father Mathew.]
