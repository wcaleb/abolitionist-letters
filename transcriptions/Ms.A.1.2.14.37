“Well, I had been [coursing?] over my volumes of the Herald of Freedom –
I have 4 years – that Rogers sent me – and how full of good things. Of
all the Anti Slavery host, not one has Rogers genius & none more
heroism, unselfishness & magnanimity. He is one of God’s own and I love
every bone in his body. ... Eliz^h^ Wright gives a poor account of the
Irish in Philad. but I fear a correct one. Their home education tends to
make them sanguinary & fanatical, and as to the Americans themselves
between disregard of honesty & defiance of the law I fear they are in a
bad way. I have no doubt but there would be bloody works in Ireland if
it were not for the influence of O’Connell & the presence of 22,000
soldiers here. I am as confident as I can be of any thing that the
government could not have done anything to endear the idea of Repeal to
the mass of the people in any war so effectually as by the course they
took in the late Trials & by O’C’s imprisonment. If they had let him
alone, the agitation would have died away. ... From all I hear O’C. &
his fellow [fine men?] are in good health & spirits. Certainly if
sympathy and popularity could keep men alive they should [be] as
vivacious as swallows. Only that I am nobody and that shortly before O’C
went in he said he would see none but repealers (which by the way is not
true) and that, not being a thoroughly {u}convinced{/u} repealer, I
might be tabooed, I would like to call on him.”
