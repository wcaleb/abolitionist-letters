Abby Kimber to RDW; Kimberton; Sarah Pugh in the margins? Her last
letter which they never received. ... O’Connell; news of mutual friends;
Philadelphia mobs; Irish Emigrants ... Discusses how Protestant Irish
nativists oppose Catholic immigration on the grounds that Catholic
emigrants are subject to priests, who are agents of the Pope. Lots of
negative remarks about the “Native American Party” and its bigotry and
inflammatory rhetoric. Doubts that a “dousing” could really have cured
HCW.

“Poor O’Connell. I tremble for him, lest he should not be able to
maintain his standing. He might be tremendous in Prison – will the
Government dare to put him there? What a tremendous ‘voice from the
jail’ {u}he{/u} would send forth!”
