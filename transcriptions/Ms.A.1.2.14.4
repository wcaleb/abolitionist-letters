NPR to RDW; Boston, at Garrison’s. O’Connell’s approaching trial. His
views on religion.

“ ‘O’Connell’s trial is coming on tomorrow,’ – says one of the children,
laying down your note which she had been reading. ... I feel some
anxiety for the grand fellow’s fate. It seems as if the would not dare
go to extremities against him, but I can’t tell how they feel at London.
They might as well hang him I suppose on such an occasion as on any
other, if {u}it would do{/u}. They would have to take him off the
Emerald Isle to do it, I should suppose, and I doubt if there is
despotism enough to carry it out in [Tower Hill?] even. Poor Ireland
would break out in desperate effervescence if it were done any where. I
want to say a word in excuse of my unlucky article on the agitator’s
dinner exhibition. I certainly think grace-saying has more occasion to
complain of me than O.C. or his friends. I speak of him in terms of
compliments enough when he is himself. The word ‘calf’ is gross, & so is
‘natural fool’, and it was rash to say them as folks feel. I was wrought
up at the moment beyond my common tone, & it shocked me to read what I
had written when I came to read it in the Liberator. I was glad I said
so many things complimentary to O’Connels personal beauty, so that he
couldn’t feel ungratified on the whole. I would be glad to be so
depicted if I could be properly & should not be offended to have my own
father or dearest friend. And now is it right for any of us ever to put
on that religious transmutation of face, that turning the countenance
outside in, that hideous humiliation & deprecation of face. I dont
believe it is. I dont believe any God worth worshipping can be pleased
with such contortions, or the slavish, [?] mortally frighted spirit that
puts them on. ... I think religion is the natural refuge of
{u}wicked{/u} humanity, & if humanity would turn righteous, it would
cease to be what is called religious. If I’m mistaken, I am willing to
be religious. I don’t want to be stubborn or opinionated about it. If we
will hold ourselves to the duty of being right, we can demand it of the
race, & not let another off under a refuge of ‘total depravity,’ or any
other priestly technicality. I’m sorry I put my O’Connell article in
just such terms. It might have been made a capital one. He is the
{u}crack{/u} man, as our yankees say, of the political earth, just now,
& superstition might have been struck a superb blow, in his case, and
everybody would have read it. ... We must get up a Convention at Boston
worth your voyaging to it. Say next May’s New England Convention. Let
the same phalanx attend it from Ireland that we found at old
[Fronsided?] London. I tell you we’ll give you a gathering worth your
while. Make {u}ambassador{/u} George Thompson & Lizzy Pease come with
you. What a ship’s company you might muster & what a time out o’er the
deep. Think of it. Come early, & make out a summer here.”
