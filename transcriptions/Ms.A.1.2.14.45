“... Now I am a little ashamed of all my talk about myself and my doings
and my people and their doings instead of giving my confessions about
the Sugar Duties more especially as I have nothing to say that will do
me much credit. The fact is I am not a good politician, nor an able
reasoner – and the side I took was rather the result of feeling than
deliberate convictions. I am afraid the arguments are against James
Haughton & myself with our friends Joseph Sturge & the British & Foreign
Committee. I act on this question much in the same mood as would have
actuated the man who would have smothered little Eli Whitney in his
cradle, from a prophetic sense of the horrible extension of slavery
consequent upon the discovery of the cotton gin. I think the B & F
Committee or the majority of them are as honestly & blindly narrow in
their views as I am myself – whilst the Government (which is partly made
up of old Slaveholders & staunch advocates for Slavery) I believe to be
thoroughly hypocritical and dishonest in the course they take on the
question. I would have no marine police nor prevention force – I would
not meddle in the matter – but I am puzzled, and I hate the idea of four
fifths of South America & all Cuba being covered with sugar plantations
& coffles of Slaves. To be sure this is ridiculous enough to apprehend
that even John Bull could swallow so much sugar, even with hungry Pat
and keen Lawney to help him. I think Richard Allen is rather proud of
his enlightened views, or he would not have written to tell of them. He
is getting rich very fast and has hardly time to turn round, so busy is
he. Nevertheless he and Ann are about to visit the Rhine and part of
Germany. ... She is expert in German, French, Spanish, & Italian & has
dabbled in I dont know how many other sorts of strange lingo. ...
[{u}BAA{/u} excerpt: Deprecates Repealers, O’Connell, the *nation*
party, and Thompson. According to Webb, GT not on great terms with ACLL
leaders.] Has Edmund Quincy been able to procure the no. of Taits
Edinburgh Magazine for July which contains one of the best political
articles I have seen on the position of Ireland in consequence of the
State Trials? As to H.C. Wright the last I heard of him was from 2
letters written about the 30^th^ of June – one to E. Pease, another to
myself – from Graffenberg. In them he mentions his intention to leave
very shortly & travel by way of [Vecina?], Munich, Bash, Geneva & Paris
back to England. [Mentions Elizabeth Pease’s patronage of HCW; calls her
one of the “rich English,” and speculates that she has more money than
all the Dublin circle put together, but that she is worthy of the
stewardship.] ... [Speaking of the Fair, he worries that he won’t have
enough money to contribute as much as last year.] I know it is thy
private opinion that charity begins at home, but it is mine that the
Anti Slavery enterprise is an effort for the whole human family and that
while slavery exists in any professedly Christian country, it is a folly
to talk of liberty, civilization or Christianity. There are very few on
this side of the Atlantic who care much or do any thing for your cause.
I [catch?] myself by thinking it cant be any great harm if I have
mistaken my gift when I [too?], and do a little for the ‘damned nigger.’
I think Anti Slavery is as much the cause of the master as of the
Slave.”
