RDW to MWC; Dublin.

“I dont know which of your circle I wrote to last, but it is no matter,
as I understand you all reap the benefit of whatever I communicate in
this way. ... [HCW has returned, looking thinner but healthier.] For
some days after his arrival he seemed inclined to take the world easy,
but he has latterly taken to spend the greater part of the day writing
in his room. I suppose he thinks he is shaking the world, but I can
perceive very little of the motion so far. ... H.C.W. does not seem to
me to be either vain or proud or self important – and yet I think he has
an exaggerated idea of the influence of his efforts for good – and
furthermore his efforts seem vastly disproportional to the greatness of
his design. ... [Has had a visitor to Dublin who became convinced that
slaves in America have it better than paupers in Ireland. Webb agrees
this may be true in some instances, but speculates that no pauper would
want to exchange places with the slave, and that at any rate the poor in
Glasgow and Edinburgh are worse off than those in Dublin.] ... I dont
know whether in my last to Quincy I told him I had called upon O’Connell
of course in prison. He was walking in a beautiful garden and looks as
ruddy & rosy as a boy of twelve, but a good deal more wrinkled – his
step is as firm & his [post?] as erect & majestic as I ever saw them. It
is said if the judges disagree in their opinions on the Writ of Error
that he & his fellow prisoners will be discharged at once, & that if
they agree & confirm the judgment of the Irish courts, he will still be
let out on giving the security required by his sentence to keep the
peace – which he certainly never broke. I hope he may ge out on the
former terms. There is some talk about the queen paying us a visit in a
month or two. I hope she wont come. The Irish owe nothing to the queen –
and I abhor the prospect of the displays of degrading servility that wd
probably take place if she came. I wish they had the pluck & the self
respect to take a royal visit at its true value. It would in fact be a
Tory Triumph, if the queen came here & [?] were feted & hurraed with Sir
Robert Peel pulling the strings. We also had Henry Vincent one of the
greatest orators of the Free Suffrage, or Moral Force Chartist Movement,
here for two weeks. He & his wife stayed with my brother James. His is a
young looking, bright eyed ardent man of 31 – his eyes & his complexion
like Garrison. ...
