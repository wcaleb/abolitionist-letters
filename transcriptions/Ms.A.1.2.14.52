NPR to RDW; Concord. His memory of Dan O’Connell and the smallest Webb;
O’Connell’s present status; Maria Waring; His love of Ireland. WLG.
“Herald.”

“Poor Dan, in prison yet, or have their {u}Lordships{/u} acknowledged
‘Error’ in their {u}protestant{/u} court below, & let him out on to the
[{u}braes{/u}?] of [Dannymand?] I am almost sorry I told about his
devotional grimaces at Lizzy Pease’s table – But did I not say it
respectfully, admiringly of the real {u}undevout{/u} O’Connell. Did I
not curse superstition because it deformed so glorious a thing as his
fine face. And would he be offended at me for that. I tell him, Richard
Webb, it is that same superstition, more than every thing else, that
rules Ireland with a rod of Iron & restrains O’Connell now of his local
liberty. It is Protestant Superstition that enables that old Windsor
Castle to keep the power to do it. ‘Fear God {u}&{/u} honor the King.’
This {u}grimacing{/u} ‘fear of God’ secures that ‘honor’ to the crown,
that enables it to play God on earth & trample humanity in the dust. I
couldn’t have struck at the infernal Idea more effectually, than in the
person & face of the grand O’Connell. I wish he knew what I am here
saying, for it is worth his while to consider it. I know it was somewhat
{u}raggedly{/u} said, dear R.D. what I wrote, but isn’t it on the whole,
rather well than ill, so far as it is worth considering at all? ... The
thought of the Shamrock makes me saddish in a moment, and these dear
ones all loved me, so {u}little time{/u} did I stay among them. What for
else could it have been? I came from far off, o’er the water, just
touched your shores & away again. ... [Reports on the Herald
controversy; Rogers is hurt that Garrison seems to be falling victim to
“the Spirit of Corporation.”] Phillips & Quincy have the misfortune to
be {u}birth{/u}-aristocrats, though they have noble heretofore joined
themselves to the outcasts. Phillips retains his manhood. Quincy’s
aristocracy has quite recovered from the shock his abolitionism gave it.
... [A sentence crossed out.] I have long witnessed its returning upon
him. He is not aware of it, but I am from the woods & can see it. I will
endure any thing but {u}aristocracy{/u}. ... [Lots of defense of
himself; sees Quincy, Garrison, Foster, etc., to be beholden to
“organization.”] ... Garrison holds politics a mortal sin, yet he fills
his paper with the doings of politicians, & [confounds?] them for not
turning their {u}politics{/u} to better account. And he holds to
embodying the anti Slavery movement in real political form, with all the
formalities of parliament or Congress, the President, the vice
President, the Secretaries, the Committees, the votes, the points of
order & the previous question. Now I say moral suasion repudiates every
one of these, as much as it does a sword blade. What is a chairman, if
every body is free to disregard his dictum. And if they are to be
governed by it, how is the meeting to execute the [?] of the Chair, but
by the {u}constable{/u}! ... I go for mere {u}speech{/u} (writ & unwrit)
as our instrumentality. Tell the truth. Let every body tell it, & in
their own way. And if they transcend propriety, {u}tell them so{/u}, &
if they wont conform, let them go {u}unconformed{/u}. That’s my sort of
moral suasion. Any thing short of it, is {u}War{/u}. ... [Regrets
Garrison’s interference, and the end of the Herald, which he doubts can
be revived in a way satisfactory to all.] I am amazed at the want of
wisdom in wise men. But this cannot be pleasing to you dear Richard.
Dont let it grieve you much. Continue to love Garrison. I am going to
retire & be forgotten forthwith. I have written you a half crazy letter,
& would send it to nobody but you.”
