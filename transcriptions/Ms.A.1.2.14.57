“Since last mail O Connell has been liberated in consequence of the
decision on the writ of error. It caused great rejoicing and excitement,
and all this I need not detail for it will be found at full length in
the papers I send by the Caledonia directed to thee for Sydney Howard
Gay. I also send another ... wherein thou will find that Dr [Meley?], a
pet priest here (and O’Connell’s private chaplain) ascribes old Dan’s
liberation to the special intervention of the Virgin Mary who doubtless
influenced Lord Denman’s decision, {u}which{/u} did the business. I am
heartily glad of the defeat of the ministry. Many of their acts or of
their servants acts in the course of the State Trials were the most
impolitic that could have been imagined. The mutilated Jury list, the
packed protestant jury, the partizan judges, all in the case of
O’Connell, who above all men, should, for the reputation of justice in
Ireland, have had a scrupulously fair trial. No wonder Sir Robert Peel
talked of Ireland being prospectively ‘his chief difficulty,’ before he
came into power. It would puzzle an arch angel. A very clever book
written by a man I have seen & know something of has been lately
published. I wonder was it reprinted in America – if so get it & read
it. It is called Ireland and its Rulers since 1829. It is I think
generally just and portrays the state of things amongst us with great
vigour & fidelity. The author is a Mr. Madden – not Dr Madden – but a
much more energetic scribe.”
