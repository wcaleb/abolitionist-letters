[Asks her to send him the Anti Corn Law & Universal Suff. Almanacs for
two last years if there are any.] “I am not surprised at what you term
R.D.W. ‘lingering predilection’ for Leavitt &c., at least not as you
are. He looks at persons a good deal with the eye of an artist merely,
without regard to their moral qualities; -- speculates about them, as we
do about {u}things{/u} – thus he is curious to examine {u}active{/u}
men, even though {u}bad{/u}: it is mental activity, character, of either
kind, which secures his interest, as a student of human nature. His
heart is large & noble, which keeps him true always to the right, but, I
imagine, he would, from {u}curiosity{/u}, not object to show Satan
himself around the ‘Lakes’ if his keen spectacles could have a chance
mean while of peering into his strange guests. ... Your friend Chas. L.
R. is going on as usual. I am, {u}entre nous{/u}, afraid your English
kindness & Irish flattery rather injured him for sober matter of fact
home toil. He has some foolish ways.”
