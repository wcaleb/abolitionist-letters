“I deeply regret what I cannot but look on as Rogers’s fanaticism about
Free Meetings and Organizations. I think E.Q. completely answered him in
his article on Organization in the Standard. Probably Rogers would think
that I am blinded by the shortsightedness of British abolitionism.
[Worries that the Herald affair will become as infamous as the transfer
of the Emancipator.] ... As to any thing of James Haughton about
O’Connell I will venture to [?] that it should be taken [{u}cum
grano?{/u}] – O’Connell is James’s weak side. Whenever he sees any thing
dishonest or mean or unsightly or ungenerous in Dan, he straightway
shuts his eyes till the offensive thing has passed by, and then opens
them and straightway Daniel is as bright an angel and as pure a patriot
as ever. I am glad O’C. has beaten the Tories – they were unjust and
acted unconstitutionally under the protection of legal [forces?]. Now
that he is out I care no more about him, and as to his tail there is not
a meaner or a more lying crew on earth. There is nothing good or great
about them. I am sick of them and their [?].”
