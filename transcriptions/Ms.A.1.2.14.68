copyediting?}

“More than a year ago D.L. Child in the Standard quoted this couplet of
Campbells in remarking on some remarks of mine about Garrison in which I
put him far above O’Connell in a moral point of view. ... with my
opinions of Garrisons real conduct & character & my {u}knowledge{/u} of
O’Connell, there could be not be [sic] a greater piece of absurd
injustice to your great man than to compare him with ours. In
magnanimity, in truthfulness, in conscientiousness, in integrity, in
singleness of mind, in disinterestedness, in purity of life, in any of
the elements of a truly beautiful and morally great character it is only
the naked truth to say that they are not to be spoken of together, and
that Garrison is immeasurably the greater man of the two. No wonder then
that should look upon it as a great pleasure and privilege to be
esteemed among the friends of such a man and his fellow labourers in the
great cause to which his life is devoted. [Discusses regrets about the
Herald issue; reiterates that Haughton is blindly devoted to O’Connell;
is not much surprised about Bradburn’s defection, because he always
judged him to be too political; Father Mathew’s financial difficulties;
HCW still in Dublin working on his book on Graffenberg.]
