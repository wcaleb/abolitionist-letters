Kimber, Abby, to RDW. Liberation of O’Connell; regrets Bradburn-Garrison
battle ... Talks about the Queen’s postage system, which by requiring
her subjects to pay, requires an even greater self-conceit on the part
of American correspondents to send something to their Irish friends,
except by private conveyance.

“These hateful politics – how they do blur the vision and sear the
conscience. The abolitionized Whigs, who were so loud in their
denunciation of slavery before the election, are now denouncing
abolitionists as heartily, and threaten us with Texas and slavery,
general repudiation and every evil that bad government may bring on the
country. ... But what a selfish being I am – nearly filled my sheet and
not said one word of {u}your{/u} grand events – the Liberation of
O’Connell. Even Cousin Sarah should have given place to him. What is he
to do, to get down {u}[as if?]{/u} from his pedestal. {u}He{/u} must
keep ascending, or henceforth and forever I put no trust in Polititians
[sic]. What is this Federal move to do for him? Will it not weaken him,
to have any half way coadjutors? He surely will not lose faith in the
real repealers.”
