NPR to RDW; Boston. In attending annual meeting of MASS. Garrison
advocating dissolution of political Union.

“I abhor everything political as instrumentalities in a moral enterprise
like ours. Garrison is advocating the dissolution of our political
Union. It is a thing our politicians alone can do, & which is as
immaterial to our purpose, as Irish repeal is to your temperance
movements. Father Mathew would have been poorly employed in agitating
Repeal as a Temperance movement. So I think of ‘Dissolution,’ in our
movement. But Garrison sees profoundly & I must look carefully before I
disparage a movement, that has his sanction & favor, as this has. It can
be brought about only by political agency, to be performed, or
influenced, by abolitionists. Garrison holding, meantime, that voting at
the polls, the incipient stage of it, is unlawful. Two thirds of the
States, or the people of 2/3, can alone, I believe, alter the
constitution, which is the compact of Union, & these must do it by the
act of suffrage at the polls. How Wm Lloyd can advocate it, when he
could not conscientiously take any part in it, I do not see. They have a
way here of urging every man to go for the abolition of Slavery in his
own way. I cannot urge them to go for it in any but the right way. I
cannot ask the captain to march his troops against the Slaveholders, &
compel them to let their slaves go free, because I do not think any
coercive influences right. I go against all agitation, to compel men to
action about any thing. It is the common dictum of nonresistants, & I
apply it in this Anti Slavery movement.”
