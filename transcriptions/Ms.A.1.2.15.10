Clapp, Henry, to RDW; Lynn.

[Although they have never met,] “I do not feel we are strangers but one
blood. The ocean don’t look so wide to me as before I heard of you and
others on its other side. It looks more friendly too – and bears me
kindlier messages than it was wont. You may not know it is a near
neighbor of mine. Its waves break a few rods from my chamber which
overlooks the illimitable expanse from one of the most favorable points
of view in the country, -- close by Nahant, within five minutes walk of
its celebrated beach. ... I have been familiar with the Sea from
childhood. I was baptized into its love before I could walk. So I
reverence it, and I love it all the more since it talks to me all about
you, and your family, and responds so openly to my hope one day to see
you face to face. At times to be sure it is gruff and [?], times when
the thunders of the upper and lower deep break in upon one another’s
tumult and the angry billows foolishly dash themselves ‘gainst the rocks
and toss each other high up the beach, and ‘foam their own shame’ – but
these times rarely occur, and this season {u}very{/u} rarely. Usually
the broad expanse spreads itself out before one in undisturbed serenity,
and its white lipped waves come lovingly up to kiss the glad shore, and
make me long to dance upon its billows with the merry sunshine or fly
over them on the wings of the western wind. Pshaw – whats the use of my
attempting to write a letter on one sheet, or from one inkbottle, when I
am continually flying off in such tangents as these? ... Alas that my
Pegasus should have his wings tied by the tough cords of time & space !!
