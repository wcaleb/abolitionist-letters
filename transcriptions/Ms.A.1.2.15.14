Randall, Marenda B., to RDW; Woodstock. Poorly informed on condition of
Irish, but vitally interested; would like information on subject,
especially of female standing, O’Connell, Fr. Mathew and temperance; her
family’s new diet, etc.

“Valued friend, ‘My Country is the world, my country-men are all
mankind.’ The condition of the Irish is a subject upon which I am very
superficially informed, but one in which I feel much interest. My object
in writing you at this time is to ask if you will so far oblige me as to
give me a touch of the condition of all classes and especially of the
females so far as regards their education in the sciences, their labor,
the comparative condition of the sexes, their progress in the moral
reforms of the day, and their standing in the scale of Nations? These
may seem like strange questions to one of your extensive information,
but I have no other apology for them than my ignorance of their answers
and an ardent desire to know them. You have an opportunity to read so
many american [sic] prints that you are well acquainted with us as a
nation; you must therefore be aware of the strong local prejudices with
which we are cursed. Not only is our country rendering herself infamous
by the institution of Slavery and general prejudice against a colored
skin but she is afflicted with a lamentable prejudice against
{u}Foreigners{/u}, so much so that it is wholly impossible for one who
has so little opportunity to read foreign prints as myself to form any
correct conclusions in reference to the real condition of other nations.
I am aware that we have some valuable citizens who have so far divested
themselves of this national prejudice as to have a heart to sympathize
with the distresses of their brothers in other climes and particularly
the national afflictions of Ireland but I have not the happiness of a
personal acquaintance with one such nobleman and hence my ignorance on
these matters. [p] I have taken a great interest in O’Connell’s history
but from the last 8 months have known little of him, will you speak of
him? And Father Matthew [sic] how much of success has crowned his
philanthropic efforts? What advancement has temperance made as a
national reform? [Talks about her diet and her family’s vegetarianism.]
... Please give me a little idea of the general system of diet among the
different classes of the Irish their comparative health and how much of
reform there is on this point among individuals. [Signed] Yours truly
for the cause of Universal Reform,”
