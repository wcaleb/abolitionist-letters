[More on Rogers – can’t believe how frosty he is being to Garrison.]

“Well Texas you’ll see is coming in – We always said it would, & were
laughed at. Garrison grew popular & was chosen a delegate to the
Convention here, quite unanimously in his ward, made a great speech,
created the most stir in the whole matter, was rapturously applauded.
The fact is there were many abolitionists in the body & when men get
together however little they may desire to act themselves they do relish
{u}strong talk{/u}.” [SHG is engaged to Lizzy Neall.] ... “Remond did
think & does still of coming over this spring. It will not be by any
advice or on any consultation with any of us that he does so. I think it
foolish but he is a wayward child. What his plans are I’ve not the most
distant idea. His services here been very valuable & his position &
testimony true & consistent.” [Repeats verbatim his estimation of
Douglass that he gave to Webb.]
