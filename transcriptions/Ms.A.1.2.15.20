“... [Discusses the accusation that old org abos are heterodox.] What do
the orthodox Christians of America or England care for the kind of
justice that is meted out to the Indians, the Affghans, or the Chinese
by their respective governments. The Mahometan doctrine of conversion by
the sword – that the military standard must precede the symbol of faith
has been preached by clergymen in England within the last few years. ...
I had a letter from Clapp by the last mail – he mentioned the applause
with which Garrison was received in Fanuiel Hall at the Anti Texas
Meeting. I think this a remarkable & most valuable proof of progress – a
sure indication of the public mind moving in the right direction. ...
The more I see and the more I hear of O’Connell the more convinced I am
that he is a poor creature in respect of moral gifts, and not to be
thought of [for an hero?] by any one who values true greatness &
excellence in comparison with Garrison. ... I cannot imagine L.M. a
third party advocate. I cant comprehend with what consciences the third
party fold withstand your disunion & anti-Constitution arguments. Except
that I have a notion that Americans bow to the Union & the Constitution
in the same idolatrous, unreasoning spirit which prostrates the
Catholics before the man and the Hindoo before Juggernaut. They are
Divinities and must not be questioned. ... [Discusses his pleasure in
Follen’s biography, as well as mentions Arnold’s Life again.] ...
[Discussing the Liberty Bell ...] “F. Bremer has evidently been poisoned
by American intercourse, for her letter has some of the usual [salves?],
which ill their consciences. ... Lewis Tappan sends us the A & F AS.
Reporter – It is almost a Missionary Magazine so filled is it with
Reports of efforts to Christianize the people of the coasts of
Negroland. ... [Not sure about the order of the pages, but here’s an
excerpt from one page:] “Indeed a man must be an American with an
American’s superstitious veneration for your Union and your Constitution
not to see in a moment the Proslavery character of the Compact & the
Document. Your disunion resolutions [?] great [valour? value?]
nevertheless, but Magna est Veritas, etc.”
