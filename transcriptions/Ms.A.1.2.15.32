Bradburn, George, to RDW; Boston.

“Our American Society changed, ‘to the right-about-face,’ last year, on
the subject of voting, under the present National Constitution, for the
abolishment of slavery. Formerly, it encouraged so voting; now it damns
the act. Formerly, those who voted for Abolition were thought to have
done Anti-Slavery some service; now, they who do so are denounced, were
so denounced at the last annual meeting of the Soc. by one of its
agents, as ‘slaveholders.’ So sudden a [somerset?] {u}I{/u} was not able
to throw. I see all the reasons for voting now, that I say for voting
when I had the happiness of being your guest in Dublin; ay, & some
cogent additional ones. Was William Lloyd Garrison a villain, was he to
be denounced as a ‘slaveholder,’ & a whole cartload of other
vituperative epithets tipped up upon him, when, some years ago, for the
express purpose of serving the cause, he {u}voted{/u} for Amasa Walker?
‘No Union with Slaveholders,’ as Rogers says, ‘{u}is{/u} a very sonorous
cry.’ He might have added: It is ‘mere sound & fury: simplifying
nothing,’ excepting to create the lying impression, that they who will
not join in bellowing it {u}go{/u} for such a union, in the sense of
supporting slavery. It is objected to the consistency of Abolitionists
remaining in the Union, that by so doing they support slavery. The
intellect of a goose might perceive, that the same objection lies
equally against the Disunionists, for staying in the country. Edmund
Quincy by staying in the country, & thus paying taxes, or permitting or
causing his parents to pay them for him, gives more support to slavery
every year, than I by holding office or voting under the Constitution,
even giving this instrument their own construction, which I believe to
be a false one, need give to it in a hundred years. ... But am I
desirous of the Union? No. And I would break it to-day & put an end to
this miserable strife among Abolitionists, if I could. Bu I see plainly,
or imagine I see plainly, that it would demand a thousand-fold more
effort, to abolish the Union, than to abolish slavery itself, under the
former. [He will continue to vote for the Liberty Party.] ...
Practically, therefore, it matters not to me, whether the Liberty Party
is composed of honest men or of scoundrels. To use your own words, ‘when
we want to work in a practical way, we must only make use of the tools
best fitted for the nature of our operations.’ If I can make
‘rottenness’ do a sound work, if I can make scoundrels work for
humanity, I’ll do so. ... But I do not believe your conception of the
character of the Liberty party to be just. ... [Discusses Rogers
affair.] ... How fortunate is the cause to have had Henry C. Wright in
‘Auld Scotia’ to meet those ‘Free Church’ panderers to our infernal
slave-system! He was just the man for them. How many Abolitionists have
you there over the water, who would dare, even at this late day, be
Abolitionists in America? There is precious little at home to try your
European Anti-Slavery. It needs to cross the Atlantic to be tested. I
doubt if {u}O’Connell{/u} would be an Abolitionists, were he a citizen
of this country, or would dare speak out against slavery were he to come
hither soliciting contributions to the Repeal, as those Scotch
[derived?] Free Church miscreants came begging for their miserable
Sectarian establishment. By the by, has the Agitator any chance of
obtaining the Repeal? I cannot, & never could, see the slightest.
O’Connell & George Thompson, & other Abolitionists with them, split, it
seems, a twelvemonth since, on the question of imposing or continuing a
discriminatory duty on slave-grown sugars; Thompson going for free-trade
in its largest sense, & declaring such a duty to be an unrighteous
interference with the consciences of her Majesty’s faithful subjects; &
O’Connell, while claiming to be also a free-trade man, maintaining that
those subjects {u}should{/u} be compelled to pay a higher price for
their sugar for the sake of diminishing, or preventing an increase of,
free-trade in negroes. Such a difference of views among {u}our{/u}
Abolitionists would create a pretty bandying of ‘hard words.’
{u}Leavitt{/u} thinks Thompson is in the right; in the right, that is to
say, so far as concerns his object, the prevention of such a
discriminating duty, & of all discriminating duties; for it is obvious,
I think, that friend T.’s {u}argument{/u} involves non-resistance, the
overthrow of all government founded on force. Ask Henry C. Wright if it
does not. Are you yet a non-resistant, practically, I mean? ... {u}May
31^st^{/u}. ... [Mentions NEAS meeting, and the frostiness towards
Rogers.] I do lament, that friends of a common cause should be so
alienated in their feelings towards each other. But all our differences
indicate one thing that {u}is{/u} really encouraging. They show, that
Abolitionists have greatly increased in number & in strength. Once,
there were not enough of us, to admit of divisions. Personally, how
deeply, during our late N.E. Con., have I wished I {u}could{/u} go with
my old friends in their disunion measures; it were so much more pleasant
to me, to cooperate, in {u}all{/u} things, with persons who have my
heartiest sympathies in so {u}many{/u} things. ... The evils of annexing
Texas, should it be, as I make little doubt it will be annexed, I do not
think will be a hundred-fold so great as many of our friends have
represented. There is neither hope nor danger of the measure’s
destroying the Union. The Whigs, having failed, by the Texas cry, to
seduce enough Abolitionists to elect that Prince of Slaveholders, Henry
Clay, will give themselves very little farther trouble in the premises.”
