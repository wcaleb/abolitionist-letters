“I understand that you have received the ‘considerably big’ box which we
sent by Hamden, per steamer 1^st^ Feby, & which contained numberless
packages, for thy special delight, sent {u}thee{/u} & each one crying
out to thy hand, for ‘address’, one for H. Martineau – E. Pease – Cobden
– Abdy – Croppers innumerable -- &c. &c.” [Is glad James Houghton has
come out of the League. He admires Cobden but has not liked some recent
actions of the League.]
