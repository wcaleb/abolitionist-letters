“I dont think it likely that anything could be had as an offering from
the Anti Corn Law people out of their [leavings? bearings?]. Thou art
aware that they are not much of Anti Slavery people or at least of
Abolitionists. I would suppose that Cobden & Bright have many more bosom
friends or at least intimates among Slaveholders than abolitionists –
witness their correspondence with Calhoun & MacDuffie and their
presentation of Bound Copies of the League to them. They are so much
brought into direct intercourse with Slaveholders in the way of business
& in the social circle both in Liverpool & Manchester that they are not
likely to have any upright notions on these points. Besides I imagine
they have so many ways of spending money that they will hardly
appropriate any part of the contributions to any other purpose than
those of the League even if they were inclined to do so from sympathy
with you.” ... [Rogers is “a fallen angel.” ... “I am heartily grieved,
and have no more hope for him.”] ... “I was delighted with Remonds
letters to Garrison about Rogers in the last Liberator. They showed
great courage in his position. ... Remember me to him most cordially.
Tell him he is often spoken of by us and that his consistent steady
course does him great honour in our eyes. When he was here he always
praised Garrison & never blarneyed America which I admired in him, for
he has nothing to praise his country for.”
