RDW to MWC. Douglass “is very popular and spoke yesterday in the Repeal
Association in O’Connell’s presence & by his request. F. D. is vastly
delighted with Dan, and I don’t wonder that any dark man should be. But
the old fellow is hollow—at least I have no confidence in him.”
O’Connell refused to reply to a request from HCW about his views of
disunionism. “His popery was greatly galled by Rogers’ coarse commentary
on his dinner table devotions.” “Frederick is touchy, huffish, haughty &
I think selfish. He is ever ready to sacrifice his friend to his joke.
He dont think of people’s feelings—and he resents advice tho’ given in
the most cautious way. This is my opinion of him as a man. As an
advocate & orator, as a company man, as a marvelous example of the
triumph over difficulties he is a wonder indeed. He is exceedingly
pleasant and amusing when he pleases. But he is uneven and unreliable. …
He is a far more interesting man than Remond.”
