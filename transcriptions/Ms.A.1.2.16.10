WP to EPN; Boston. Sends volumes of the *Non-Resistant*, volumes of the
*Liberty Bell*, etc. Thinks Bassett is much changed and heading in the
wrong direction. … “I agree with you & reject H Martineau. I don’t see
why you should not help us dash the Union to pieces. I hope to & it
seems now as if I might, live to see the day when it falls asunder
unless some kind Providence will cleanse it first from its [severe?]
devils. Men who would have whispered Disunion with white lips a year ago
now love to talk about it, & many leading men will talk as we were once
laughed at for talking a while ago. Our Texas Comee was a good thing
dragging forward some like Adams and [I. C.?] Phillips &c who were all
ready but didn’t know it & now talk just as we do only can’t quite
identify themselves with us. But the Whig Party … mean to ostracise
them, little thinking that it is sawing off the bough on which they are
sitting as the clown did in the story. … Remond I overpersuaded last
summer into not coming to England, but I believe he still hankers after
it, & will come unless he gets into some business. His health is bad,
his expensive habits have led him into some debts, & he writes that he
shall not on acct of health labor more at present in the cause. {u}This
about his debts is confidental{/u}.”
