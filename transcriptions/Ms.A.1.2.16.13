Frederick Douglass to Francis Jackson; Dundee, Scotland

Updates on his tour. Before the first ellipsis: “I beg you to do what I
feel confident you are seldom inclined to do, namely, look over the many
acts of kindness you have performed toward myself and the people with
whom I am identified. These acts justify me in thinking you will not
object to having a line from me. From the first day I steped [sic] out
of obscurity on the Antislavery platform at Nantucket to the day I
steped [sic] on the deck of the Cambria for these shores you stood by
me, to encourage strengthen and defend me from the assaults of my foes,
and the foes of my race. I will not trouble you with any eulogy, for I
know such would be disagreeable to your ears, but you must allow me to
tell you that your acts are not forgotten. When I was a stranger, rough,
unpolished, just from the bellow handle in Richmond’s brass foundry in
New Bedford, when I was regarded and treated as a being to be despised,
when I was scarce able to write two sentences of the English language
correctly you took me into your drawing room, welcomed me to your table,
put me in your best bed, and treated me in every way as an equal Brother
at a time when to do so was to expose your self to the hot displeasure
of nearly all your neighbours. These things I still remember, and it
affords me great pleasure to speak of them. Pardon me for reminding you
of these things now. … It is quite an advantage to be a ‘nigger’ here, I
find. I am hardly black enough for british taste, but by keeping my hair
as woolly as possible, I make out to pass for at least a half a negro at
any rate. My old Friend Buffum finds the tables turned upon him here
completely. The People lavish nearly all their attention on the negro. I
can easily understand that such a state of things would greatly
embarrass a person with less sense than he, but he stems the currant
[sic] thus far nobly. I have received letters from America expressing
fears that I may be spoild [sic] by the attentions which I am
receiving—well ‘tis possible, but if I thought it probable, the next
steamer should bring me home to encounter again the kicks and cuffs of
proslavery. Indeed I shall rejoice in the day that shall see me again by
your side, battling the enemy, and I should rejoice in it, even though I
were to be subjected to all the regulations of Colorphobia with which we
used encounter. I glory in the fight as well as in the victory. Make my
love to all your family [known] gratefully yours, Frederick Douglass.”
