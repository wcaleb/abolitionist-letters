**[1846, 01] Ms.A.1.2.16.14**

Francis Jackson, Draft of petition to Massachusetts General Court
calling on the state to leave the Union because of Texas annexation and
become “an independent and free government, either for herself alone, or
with such other States as may be disposed to co-operate with her in
trampling upon tyranny and carrying into full effect the self-evident
truths set forth in the old Declaration of Independence.” Mentions as
one of the sins of Texas annexation that it violated the Constitution.
Pencil note indicates that it appears in the *Liberator*.
