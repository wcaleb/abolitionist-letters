AWW to EPN; Weymouth. Talks about the introduction of speeches to the
annual fair. “Wendell spoke in the most eloquent & beautiful manner.
John P. Hale too, who has behaved so well in Hew Hampshire politics
spoke to great [acceptance?]. He is a pleasant agreeable man, & tho’ but
a very half & half Abolitionist now, will, I hope go on to perfection. …
I rejoice extremely over the prospect of the abolition of the Corn Laws.
As far as I understand the question at all, I am a Free Trader. There is
a good deal of consternation here in view of the alteration of the
Tariff of 1842. I am delighted at my very heart, for first, I really
believe in the goodness of the measure & secondly, I shall delight in
the punishment of Messrs Lawrence & Appleton whose vile letters about
Texas you will have read. I long to pull down the cotton manufactures
for which they have sold their souls.”
