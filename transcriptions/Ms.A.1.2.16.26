Douglass to RDW; Klimarnock

On receipt of books and Liberty Bell from MWC. “I did not expect a
‘liberty bell’ from Mrs Chapman since she is so fearful that I may be
bought up by the London committee. It may be pleasant to her to learn
that I am not yet bought up by the London committee. I am still an old
organized, garrison abolitionist. And shall probably remain such. At any
rate poverty shall not drive me nor money allure me from my present
position.”
