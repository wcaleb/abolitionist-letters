Abby Kimber to RDW; Philadelphia

Pugh; Friends; JQ Adams’ speech

“If there only were a magnetic telegraph from Philadelphia to Dublin,
one that would transmit a joke, fresh and funny across the broad
Atlantic so quickly that the wit might not evaporate by the way, I would
even now tell you all about cousin Sarah Pugh’s marriage.” Chatty,
joking letter. Asks whether the Repeal Rent is solely dispensed at
O’Connell’s discretion. If it is his common fee, then she doesn’t think
the charges made against his use of it are just.
