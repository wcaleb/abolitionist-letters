Bradburn to RDW

“I see your Tory Administration is likely to get out of power on
essentially the same question that put it into power—the sugar duties.
As a mere Abolitionist, I think O’Connell nearer right on this question,
than Geo. Thompson, who, to be consistent, should [ask] that Government
should not coerce men in any thing, it seems to me; that is to say, he
should be a Non Resistant. It is wonderful how {u}many{/u} adopt
premises involving Non-Resistance. I don’t know but I shall be driven
into it by the force of their logic, yet.”
