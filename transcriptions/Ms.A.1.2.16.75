Mary Grew to Helen Garrison; Salem

Mentions hydropathy. She is sure that Garrison’s health will improve on
his trip abroad. “Do you think he could be prevailed on to visit one of
the hydropathic establishments there? I suppose there are some, where
the treatment is equal to that at Graefenburg. Bulwer, you know, speaks
very highly of Malvern. I mention this, as I know that you are very
desirous that he should try this treatment, and I thought that he might
be more easily induced to resort to some establishment near at hand,
than to take the long journey to Graefenburg. I am endeavoring to make
the friends of our cause in Pennsylvania understand the fact that Mr.
Garrison’s health is very precarious.”
