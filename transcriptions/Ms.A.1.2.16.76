Reports on his return voyage. “If you only knew how much your friends
want to see you in this country you would just step into a ship some day
and come over. Mrs. Chapman and her sisters, said they would give more
to see you, than any other Person in all Europe. I hope we may have a
Worlds Convention some day in New England when we shall have a great
number of the good friends I met in England Ireland & Scotland over to
see us.”
