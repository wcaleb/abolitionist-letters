Mary Carpenter to WLG; Bristol

Ever since she read Martyr Age, “I have felt the warmest sympathy with
your exertions, & desire to have the privilege of personal intercourse
with you. And now I hope that you will reckon me among your
{u}friends{/u}. What a close ‘bond of brotherhood’ it is, without any
signing or pledging, to be all working together God’s work!”
