Jackson to WLG; Boston

Reports on political movements at home. Out of curiosity, he was present
at both the Democratic and Whig nominating conventions in Faneuil Hall.
Reports that Sumner and other antislavery Whigs tried to bring slavery
on the platform but were defeated by Cotton Whigs. “I am disposed to
look kindly upon the conscience whigs & have done all I can consistently
to cheer them on because I see that they are in earnest. One of these
things must happen to them within twelve months, they must either
revolutionize the party or come out from it or be whipt quietly into the
traces again. They are on paper at least in a bad position viz in a
proslavery party. I cannot give them a longer credit than 12 months,
long enough to bear a faithful testimony. If they stand there longer we
must open our lower tier upon them. John P. Hale came at the invitation
of the conscience whigs & abolitionists & filled Faneuil Hall to
overflowing & acquitted himself manfully. He was a man of one idea.
Anti-Slavery was his theme.” Also reports on a meeting at Faneuil Hall
as a result of a fugitive slave captured in Boston and returned to New
Orleans. Among the speakers were J. Q. Adams, Howe, Wendell Phillips,
Charles Sumner, and Theodore Parker.
