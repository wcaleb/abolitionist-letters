Various subjects. Efforts of Famine Relief. “You will see by our Papers,
how many causes of encourage[men]t there are, for persever[in]g labor in
the harvest-field of Freedom. The increas[in]g interest & action in
Delaware & some other slave states, the freedom of discussion in our
Congress, the Editorials in our political Papers, the acts of our
Legislatures, lastly, & as some will think {u}leastly{/u}, our success
in calling large mgs. Of women to confer together & to petition on this
subject, all these inspire us with hope that Slavery’s days are
numbered. We give the Anti-Slavery League also our fraternal all-hail
for its broad platform putting to shame the London committee & World’s
Convention. When that League shall call another convention, how we,
women, will all hie thither. How came you to let Fred[eric]k Douglass
yield to his human weakness so far as to suffer himself to be bought? …
It surprises us still more that our clear-sighted Garrison should
justify it as he does. Much as may be said in extenuat[io]n or
palliation of such purchases in extreme cases, we ought never to admit
the principle as sound, and certainly Fredk’s was not one of the extreme
cases, as he was out of the clutches of the slaveholders, & the sum paid
will not secure him from their vengeance.”
