William Lovett to WLG (printed in *Liberator*)

Has attended most of the Council meetings of the Anti-Slavery League,
whose efforts are “teaching [millions] that slavery, in every land, is
but a link in the same great chain of oppression which binds the
multitude in all countries and climes.” Wants to know if he and Vincent,
working with the League, should still prepare an Antislavery Address to
the United States and secure signatures. See also BAA No. 251. Addressed
to “my dear friend.”
