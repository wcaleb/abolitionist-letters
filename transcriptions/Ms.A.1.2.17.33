James Mott to RDW

Contrasts Ireland and USA.

“… Sarah Pugh & Abby Kimber have just left us, after reading their
letters to you & E. Pease. When we meet the incidents of our visit to
your country are frequently subjects of interesting remembrance &
conversation. …” Talks about efforts for Irish famine relief. “What are
the Repealers doing? We do not see much of their doings in the public
papers. O’Connell’s day is over for doing any more in that line, & I am
unable to discover that all his agitation has produced any radical
improvement. The poor laws & relief laws of various kinds that the
British Parliament are nothing more than plasters to cover a putrid
sore, without any healing virtue. We have abundance of room for all the
emigrants that can come; but many are so poor & entirely destitute when
they arrive at our sea ports, that they have not the means of going into
the country, where they could find employment & soon by industry &
sobriety make themselves comfortable.”
