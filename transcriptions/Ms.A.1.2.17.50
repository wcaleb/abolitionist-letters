Abby Kimber to Hannah Webb

Hydropathy, O’Connell, etc.

“Gertrude writes that Edward has had the measles, very lightly, all the
[infections?] having been brought out by the {u}wet sheet!{/u} Last
winter he had the whooping cough before he was six months old, and was
treated the same way. Gertrude seems more successful in that practice
than you were. You did not mention the health of your son Alfred in your
last. I hope he has become strong again. Water Cure establishments are
multiplying in this country. It will be well for us if they become
general, for we are a decidedly Doctor-ridden country—Law, Physic and
Divinity, all have rooted themselves here spontaneously, and having no
established props, they twine themselves with every thing, so that I
fear they will be as difficult to eradicate as in old countries, where
they are held up by authority. [p] By yesterday’s papers we see that
O’Connell is dead! Where will Ireland find his like again. … I have
begun to fear for {u}our{/u} land too though not for just now. What a
mass of ignorance and superstition we are receiving from Europe, and
what a mass among our slaves—the colored people believe in witchcraft
and fortune telling almost universally, and the ignorant Roman Catholic
is very little removed from the slave, in intelligence. How Frederic
Douglass kept himself free from the contaminating influence I marvel
more and more. The Colored Men are {u}often{/u} good orators, but the
wonder in Douglass, is that he is able to appreciate the
{u}refinements{/u} and {u}delicacies{/u}, which he was never taught to
practice. He must have had an innate sense. If he is alike proof against
the flatteries he received abroad, and the indignities he receives at
home he is a paragon! It is too much to expect from anyone, and I hold
myself ready to excuse much from him.”
