“I attended to your request about the Water Cure Review, & inclose a few
lines which Johnson of the {u}Tribune{/u} inserted in that paper at my
request. It is one of the widest circulated papers in the Union, & goes
wherever reform, as well as Whiggery, is mentioned. The Liberator you’ll
see. The Prisoner’s Friend & Standard have copied it. The Freeman &
Bugle will, possibly notice: so that you may take to yourself the credit
of having placed the notice before at least {u}50,000{/u} readers. Your
cordial description of Ben Rhydding would almost draw Ann across the
water. She looks longingly on the Cure, & may try it yet. … I’ll say no
more now, but that she has been trying for some three months the wet
bandage, & though it has worked well, & we hope a little still, yet at
present she has reaped no benefit. She has been growing worse & worse
this last year. … What a glorious age we live in! Intellect, literature,
wit, poetry, & even government seem awakening to their duties, of
remembering the forgotten & attending to the neglected. How delighted
Geo. Thompson must be. The Reform Bill of 1831 seems to me to be just
bearing fruit. It has taken it till now to come to maturity. What an
influx of new blood into Parliament. Vincent (how I shd like to see
him!) Fox, Col. Thompson, O’Connor, & our Geo. We shall see great times
I think. G. T. has now an arena worthy of him, & the world for his
audience. May he prove fit for his high place in all things. His
election seems to have been carried on on noble principles.” Says the
Liberty Party, true to predictions, is dying out and merging with other
movements.
