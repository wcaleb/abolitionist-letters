David Ruggles to WLG (written by amanuensis); Northampton Water-Cure

Offers water-cure treatments free of charge.

“Dear Friend Garrison, I regret to learn that you have recently had a
relapse. You really should keep quiet, and free from excitement. From
what I can learn of your symptoms, you need to restore an equilibrium of
circulation, and [illegible] the nervous, and muscular systems. Why
can’t you spend five or six weeks at a water-cure, and accomplish it,
but a very moderate course of treatment? Come out here, and it will
afford me the highest gratification, to put you through free of charge.
I have at present, but [hole in page obliterates number] patients, and
can give you the very best attention. Having no doubt, that a simple
water-cure diet, and a gentle, bracing course, would afford you
substantial benefit, I shall feel deeply grieved, to learn of your
running down, without embracing nature’s own remedy. … Come,
{u}wash{/u}, and be {u}healed{/u}. Your friend, D. Ruggles.”
