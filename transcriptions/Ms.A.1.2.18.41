“Your kind note by the hands of Anne Knight was most welcome. ...
[Mentions forwarding Paris items for the Bazaar.] ... “I am thankful to
hear of the success of General Taylor. The longer the new free soil
party can be kept out of the presidential seat, the purer they will be
kept, & the more surely will their political agitation produce a moral
effect. Success would be their moral extinction. Abolitionists have now
only to reiterate their testimony – keep up their publications &
lectures. Too many of their small number will undoubtedly be swept into
the Free Soil Movement – so much easier is it to be {u}carried{/u} than
to {u}carry{/u}. ... I hope to be more useful here than at home to our
cause for I can do more financially, at least I hope to be able to do
so. My time is entirely occupied for the present moment with the
education of my children, but my thoughts are at the same time devising
plans for the cause. I like Paris. They tell me its air of society &
festivity is gone, but as I have no means of comparison in my own mind I
can only say it still continues gay enough for me. I think that a
life-long observation of the markings of republican institutions,
enables me to judge of the state of things here in some senses better
than the Parisians, & I consequently feel more hopeful than many of
them. ‘See,’ they say – how grave every face you meet looks! it is
because of their anxiety which has come upon the people since the late
revolution.’ But I, knowing experimentally that liberty is a
{u}serious{/u} thing, & self-government the assumption of a {u}grave{/u}
responsibility, cannot help auguring good & not ill of this new face the
people wear. The {u}Parisians{/u} see nothing before them but civil war.
They are unaware of the large safety-valve afforded by free speech –
freedom of assemblage – a free press, which effectual prevents
explosion, however appearances may threaten. Their fears see in Louis
Bonaparte only a prince disguised, & in [Cavaignac?] only a despot
displayed; & they have yet to learn by experiment that by the new order
of things, both prince & despot in [disposition?], can only be
functionaries of their own in fact. The most intelligent men of the
Nation, -- the Majority of the General Assembly, for example, have
learned this & are not afraid to sustain Cavaignac, as their own
[heel-?]servant & exponent. They are not yet peaceably enough disposed
to be fit masters for a more peaceful servant like Lamartine. If his
health does not fail, he will be likely to come in sight again [few?
four? some?] years hence.”
