“I know you will rejoice to hear that we have been able to do somewhat
for its [the cause’s] service even here. We forwarded three immense
cases of articles for the fair, so selected that they will not be
duplicates of the Contributions of English Friends. ... Before we leave
Paris I trust we shall be able to do something more effectual for the
cause. The way seems to open to inspire a sympathy for it. [p] My
objects in coming hither are completely answered as far as regards my
children. They have made great progress in all they have undertaken.
Aside from success in particular branches of education, it is good to
become cosmopolitan early in life, & to be able to say with an
experimental feeling, ‘My Country is the World My Countrymen are all
Mankind.’ It is a foolish pride & patriotism which does more to sustain
slavery than any thing else, except the love of power & money. ‘Our
country right or wrong’ is very apt to be the war-cry of those who have
seen no country but their own. Abolitionists are to be excepted from
this. To them the {u}cause{/u} has acted as an inspiration on this
ground as well as on many others. All my family here, comprising my
sisters Caroline & Emma Weston & my daughters Elizabeth & Anne & my son
Henry, -- all unite in most affectionate remembrances to you. It does
not seem to us as if you were one whom we had never seen. We {u}have{/u}
all met in the spirit.”

“I envy you the neighborhood etc. etc. of Cobden – that is a man I much
long to see. Brown seems to go on remarkably well in England. I am glad
you met him. ... Pennington is with you just what he was here,
self-seeking, trimming & utterly unreliable, nothing but the inevitable
necessity of his black skin makes him an abolitionist.”
