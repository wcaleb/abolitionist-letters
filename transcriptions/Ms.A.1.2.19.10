Pugh, Sarah, to Webbs; Philadelphia. ... Peace Congress ...

“That must indeed have been a delightful fortnight at Paris. [?] to be
‘marked with golden letters.’ What special divertisement you must have
had in watching that motley assembly, the ‘Peace Congress.’ Talking with
a friend last evening on the inconsistency of the practice with the
professions of many of the members, ‘Yes they are inconsistent
characters in the eye of the common observer, but to one who regards the
‘dual nature of man’ these persons are not so ludicrous as they might
seem.’”
