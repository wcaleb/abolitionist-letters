Ashurst to RDW

“You will be pleased to know that Mr. Armstrong of Bristol has had an
interview with Mazzini with which as I understand he was much pleased.
He (Mr. Armstrong) had previously transmitted a large packet to Kossuth
which Mazzini at my instance delivered to Kossuth putting him in
possession of the Anti-Slavery case. [p] I believe that all you could
wish has been done to possess Kossuth with right and just views on the
subject of American Slavery. [p] I shall probably meet Kossuth on Sunday
next at the house of one of my Daughters. [p] Mrs. [Lemmi?] and her
child will reside for a time with a friend of ours and if you write any
thing to him it can be easily conveyed.”
