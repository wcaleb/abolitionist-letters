Furness, William Henry, to WLG; Philadelphia. His opinion of Kossuth –
some of the reasons backed by definite examples.

“I wrote to Mr E Quincy the other day about Kossuth & asked him to show
you what I said. He may not have thought it worth while or he may not
have had an opportunity. Let me take occasion to repeat to you what I
said to him. I do it with more confidence, because our friend, McKim,
whose sound moral judgment you know, is, I believe, entirely of my mind
in regard to this extraordinary man. I felt with you at the first that
he was trimming, & I thought of him with sadness, for I had rather have
a great & true man than the political liberation of twenty Hungarys. But
some things he has said since he came here have given me, as I think, an
insight into his position. He was seen to read very attentively the
Anti-Slavery Banner extended across the Street at the Anti-Slavery
office which was large & imposing. It read ‘Welcome the Exile. “Every
inhabitant of the land should be equal before the Law” Kossuth’. It
represented the old bell with the Inscription on it ‘Proclaim liberty to
{u}all the land{/u} &c.’ When he reached his quarters at the hotel in
his first speech, he said, ‘In the air which you breathe the passage of
time into eternity is marked by that bell which proclaimed liberty to
all the land, but liberty is not in all the land, nor in all the world.’
Rush Plumley whose Anti-Slavery zeal you know, heard him & was startled
at hearing him speak thus. Again, in his speech at the Banquet, the very
explicitness & fulness [sic] with which he declared that he had not
meddled & would not meddle with our domestic questions, meaning as he
declared, the Slavery question, indicate that he is under an erroneous
impression. In the same breath in which he disclaimed meddling he said
with marked emphasis (altering the quotation) ‘Indeed I more & more
perceive, in the words of Hamlet, there are more things in heaven &
earth than {u}were{/u} dreamed of in {u}my{/u} philosophy.’ Now may it
not be that he has got the impression that we are all actually engaged
in abolishing Slavery? The men in the Senate who speak most eloquently &
in his behalf are reported to him as on the Abolition side. He falls in
with H.W. Beecher a leading clergymen – Anti-Slavery, with Bryant an
eminent poet & editor. How can he escape the idea that we have really
taken the matter in hand, & how can he doubt that a nation which must
appear to him so young & vigorous, is equal to the correction of any
abuse? Does he not hear the most sweeping declamations about Liberty? He
is not yet an American Abolitionist, & as E.Q. says who but an American
Abolitionist can know how hypocritical & I may add, to use E Q’s own
word, how ‘snobbish’ we are? You may rely upon it, my dear Mr Garrison,
{u}his philosophy{/u} has never dreamed that a nation as free as we are,
a nation that has put forth the Declaration of Independence, a nation,
so many of whose prominent men he hears are anti-slavery, is all the
while hugging Slavery as the essential & blessed element of its life,
union & prosperity. I believe that he is beginning to dream of this, &
that it was some obscure dream of this sort that suggested the quotation
from Hamlet. I do not know what else he could mean. He does not yet know
that it is American Slavery which controls American policy that it is
the commanding principle of the administration of this government at
home & abroad. He will find it out, because this it is that will make
the failure of his appeal to the government inevitable. He will see the
simple truth that American Slavery is the one obstacle to the
deliverance of Europe, because it is the one thing that palsies our
influence, that influence which he would obtain & which he deems so
important. And when he sees it, but we must grant him a little time as
it was beyond the dream of his philosophy, -- I have strong confidence
that he will tell what he sees. The man himself makes a profound
impression upon every one who hears him. There is a simplicity &
truthfulness about him which go straight to the heart. I cannot believe
there is an atom of dough in his face. Unlike the good Samaritan he
finds the poor slave, his wounded brother man, surrounded by a host of
Priests, Levites, Senators, & what not, who seem to be busily
ministering to him, & of course, as his interference is under the
supposed circumstances unnecessary, he is disposed to pass silently on.
[p] I pray you, understand me. I have troubled you with all this not for
the Liberator, but for your private ear. Please don’t publish it. ...
Kossuth was more powerfully stirred, I imagine, by Dr Elder’s speech at
the Banquet than by anything he has heard in this country. I did not
hear it, as I left the instant Kossuth finished, but they say it kindled
him, Kossuth. The next speech he makes afterwards, at Baltimore, he
says, he grows unwilling to speak in English, since we have such
eloquent men among us and the Dr, he must learn, is an Anti-Slavery man.
I think Kossuth will do us more good than we can do him. He has taken
such a hold of people’s hearts that they will hardly endure that our
‘domestic concern’ should meddle with {u}him{/u}. It has meddled with
him already most insultingly, & when he sees that fact, it will absolve
him from all his promises not to meddle with {u}it{/u}. You will
perceive that the view of his position which I suggest, casts no
reflexion upon his sagacity, for it is past the philosophy of the wisest
to dream of such a thing on earth as a republic like this cherishing
slavery, building its freedom on the crushed rights of millions, &
prepared to intervene in the affairs of other nations only when the
Slavery which it cherishes can be advantaged thereby. [p] Pardon me for
this trespass. I confess Kossuth has touched & fascinated me but this
you will see.”
