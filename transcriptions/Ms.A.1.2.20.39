Is glad that Pease’s health is improving at Ben Rhydding. Is looking
forward to finally meeting Pease in person. “How earnestly do I [treat?]
all that Wendell & Anne have told me of you, all your kind letters of
encouragement to us. … how earnestly do I try to personify all this
kindness & sympathy; and obtain an idea of you before I see you, instead
of patiently waiting till we meet. I long to see you to tell you all I
have [heard?] about in Paris. I have left {u}many friend[s] I knew
there{/u}, more or less instructed in our cause, and in process of
organizing a society to cooperate with American Anti-Slavery Society &
Garrison. Among those thus sympathetically disposed, let me name Madame
Bremer [Bremier?], the wife of the last Ministre des Affaires
[Etrangiers?], Madame [Varin?], the wife of Louis Phillippe’s chef de la
[hote?] civile, Mlle de Montgolfier the daughter of the celebrated
Aueronaut, Madame Belloc, the translator & friend of Miss [Engemont?],
with her daughters Mem Millet and Madame Redelsperger, Madame Mohl, the
friend of Madame [Recamine?] & wife of the professor of Oriental
literature in the College de France, Madame Martin-Paschoud, the wife of
the Protestant Evangelical Pastor of the same name, the Baroness de
Channe the Wife of General de Channe, who is descended from the Stuart
family & quite proud of his Island blood. Madame de Lamartine has me
assured of one of her Warmest Sympathies. She has been ill in bed a
great part of the winter but never too ill to see us & to cheer us about
the cuase. The Princess [Ypsilanti?] & her family have also been most
intimate & sympathizing friends. I cannot express to you the Singular
effect it produces on my mind to find persons, drawn instead of repulsed
by the cause.”
