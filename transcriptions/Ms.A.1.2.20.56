“I often think of you & wish I could see you again, and assure you, that
I have lost none of that deep affection and love, which I had for you
when I was in Ireland. Time has done nothing but to increase it, and I
can truly say, that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to learn
of your good fortune and happiness. … It is now almost six years since I
was in Ireland, and yet it seems to me but a day, time passes so
rapidly.”
