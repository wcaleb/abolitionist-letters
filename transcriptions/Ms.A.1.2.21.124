WP to EPN; Northampton.

“Coming up here last summer brought you vividly to our minds, as we came
to try your own valued water cure. This is the spot where that deserving
colored man Dr. Ruggles, penniless, sick & blind undertook to establish
a Cure. In spite of all obstacles added to his color, such was his
energy & perseverance that he succeeded & left at his death buildings
that had cost near $10000, and a most enviable reputation for high
character, great sagacity & eminent skill. Dr Munde who has succeeded
him says every thing he hears of Ruggles raises his opinion higher &
higher of his remarkable ability. Cath. Beecher, sister of Mrs. Stowe,
was once his patient. Munde arrived in Boston while Ruggles lay on his
death bed, about four years ago. With great kindness he started for
Northampton to try his skill in relieving him, having become interested
in the man from some talk with a friend of ours. Unfortunately Ruggles
was Bad when he arrived, but the consequence was that he concluded to
purchase the Establishment. His success has been marked. He is crowded
with patients so as to be obliged to have almost every house in the
village (we are a little village two miles from the town, which some
folks foolishly call Florence because of a silk manufactory established
here). We came up last July, for the first six weeks Ann could not begin
water treatment being troubled with an inflamed eye &c but now for about
three months she has been under such treatment as her delicate condition
can bear. We tried bandages but they gave her so much pain, they were
discontinued, then the dripping sheet but soon left that for the pack
which she takes daily & manages to bear—[sits?] baths we are aiming at &
hope soon to achieve. The Doctor does not much encourage us & Ann
herself has not much hope, but {u}I have{/u}, though to be sure up to
the present time she {u}seems{/u} to grow worse & not better. … I am
determined to think she is only now going back in order to get better
the faster by & by. Still I am bound to confess she has no more
appetite, does not sleep quite as well, cannot move about any more if
she does as much as before. … Still don’t despair—perhaps in six months
I may have good news to write you & be assured you are one of the first
I shall send it to.” Antislavery cause is progressing. “We gain ground
daily. The recent total annihilation of the National Whig party by the
defeat of Scott, is, probably, destined to result in the formation very
soon, of two great parties Northern & Southern—the beginning of the end.
I rejoice beyond measure in the election of Gerrit Smith to Congress. It
is a striking sign of the times. His presence will be itself an
argument.” Hopes Uncle Tom’s Cabin will increase public attention to the
cause in Britain.
