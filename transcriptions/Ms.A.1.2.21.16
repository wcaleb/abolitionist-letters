[Refers to Webb’s forthcoming pamphlet:] “I have read attentively and
critically the parts in wh you refer to Mr Scoble’s conduct in times
past. Let them go {u}as they are{/u}. His conduct during his time with
Birney and Stanton, was what you have described it. In Edinburgh, in the
house of John Wigham Jr., and in the presence of Mr Birney and Mr & Mrs
Stanton, he was so calumnious & malignant in his statements, that before
all present I branded him as a libeller [sic] and a coward, & dared him
to meet me in public and repeat his idle slanders. Mrs. Stanton
afterwards told Mrs. Thompson, that on their progress from London to
Scotland, he had in Every company sought, by Statements wh {u}she knew
to be false{/u}, to injure the Abolitionists of the Old Organization
party; and she further said, that had told her husband she would go no
further than Glasgow in company with {u}the man{/u}. [p] On his return
from America, in 1839, he was my guest in Edinburgh. He then sought to
poison my mind against Garrison and the abolitionists of Boston &
Philadelphia, by the most atrocious charges of {u}impiety{/u} and
{u}licentiousness{/u}. I demanded the {u}proof{/u}. He resorted to every
art of evasion. ... I subsequently demonstrated for myself, that his
charges were the invention of a fiendlike intellect, exercised for the
purpose of blackening those whom he could not resemble in their holy
devotedness to the cause of the Slave. Were I to sit down to write
Scoble’s history, in Connection with the Anti-Slavery movement, I should
be able to show that he has been one of the worst and most efficient
Enemies of the Slave. For many years he has been a poisonous Creeping
plant upon the Anti-Slavery tree in this country. [Briefly talks about
his own alienation in 1839 from Sturge and the new organization; how his
British India labors were misrepresented.] ... At the Convention in
1840, they made Thomas Clarkson (Oh! Shame) the dupe & victim of their
unworthy arts. They did all they could to murder the reputation of
Garrison, Rogers, Remond, the Motts &c. They fastened on Collins with
envenomed fangs, & [hunted? punted?] him from the Country; not however
until he had published the Narrative of their Secret Circulation of
false charges against him and the Massachusetts abolitionists. But time
would fail to tell of their conduct, on the sugar question in 1845, --
their treatment of Wright & Garrison in ’46 – their {u}overtures{/u} to
Douglass, their defection in the matter of the Evangelical Alliance –
their short coming on the free Church question – their systematic
practice of the {u}suppressio veri{/u} & the {u}suggestio falsi{/u} in
the Reporter &c &c &c &c &c. I deeply regret I ever left the Anti
Slavery field, & most gladly would I renter it, that I might if possible
lift the cause above the damp & fetid atmosphere into which these men
drag all who are weak or ignorant enough to become their victims.

[Also enclosed in this folder is an April 15 letter detailing a recent
reelection rally Thompson gave for his constituents. After he had left
the meeting, a friend told him that Scoble was there, and stood in the
courtyard talking to a small crowd denouncing Thompson, saying he had
deserted his duty by going to America, and pledging not to vote for him,
even though he was not a member of the borough. T’s friend debated with
him and eventually he skulked away. Thompson talks about his trip and
says he was well received by audiences throughout America.]
