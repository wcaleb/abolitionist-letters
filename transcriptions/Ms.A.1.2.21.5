McKim to WLG; Philadelphia.

“I forward to you to day, via New York, a package of books just received
from Paris. They are a donation to you from the Hon. Victor Schoelcher,
late member of the French Chamber of Representatives, & comprise all his
works on the slave question. He has desired me to present them to you –
which I take great pleasure in doing – as a token of his high
appreciation of your services in the cause of Emancipation & his sincere
sympathy with you in your labors.”
