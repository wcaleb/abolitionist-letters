Reports his loss of the recent Tower Hamlets election. But the
Parliamentary returns have been “favourable to the radical interest.
Some twenty additional men, going the length of the principles of the
National Reform Association, have been returned.” It is possible that
radicals will now insist on “the *Ballot*.” “The system of vote by
ballot, if established, will make thousands of voters who are now
enslaved, free, and secure, to a great extent, fair play for those who
are unable or unwilling to resort to bribery and coercion. Mr. Cobden
and his followers in Manchester intend to agitate vigorously for this
point in the People’s Charter.” But he thinks that financial reform and
East India Company reform will have to come first. Reports on the huge
success of *Uncle Tom’s Cabin*.
