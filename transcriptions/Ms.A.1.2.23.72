**[1853, 09] Ms.A.1.2.23.72**

Ashurst to Garrisons; Muswell Hill. Seems like it’s written by an
amanuensis.

“I landed in Liverpool Midnight on Saturday last. We were 10 days & 10
hours out the last 3 hours were occupied by the customs in clearing the
luggage & ascertaining that no one landed what belonged to him without
paying the duty so unwisely imposed upon the right of People to exchange
their own with each other.” His health improved while at sea. Very
grateful for their kindnesses to him, and especially Mrs. G’s attention
while he was ill. Has written another letter signed Edward Search. His
wife is about to go to a “Water Cure Establishment at Great Malvern in
England.” Ashurst has apparently been to the U.S.
