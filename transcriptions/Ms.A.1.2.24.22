Pugh to RDW and HW

“Have I not reveled with you in Parker Pillsbury’s visit! I know he will
be in many respects after Richard’s own heart and just at this time how
much will there be for him to hear & tell. That ‘drawing room’ in the
evening, when friends are with you, and that ‘dear little parlor, which
thought not having seen its finished state I know, in the morning, will
witness your ‘{u}good times{/u}.’”
