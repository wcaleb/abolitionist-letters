Pugh to RDW

Has just returned from the Annual AASS Meeting in New York. “At these
gatherings I always feel the wish to draw you into closer relations to
us, if it be only by the gossiping details of personal experience. …
When I came to England two years since, I thought what a change since my
former visit, thirteen years before. Things do not look so settled &
finished, as though little more could be done. Houses are being torn
down & new ones are building on every side. Why this is very like
America. But lo! On my return here, there was ten times more of the same
thing. One could scarcely walk the streets in many places, so choked up
were they with the debris of the old & the materials for grand new
edifices that were rising in their places. The bustle & stir of N. Y.
were oppressive to me, on landing, and if possible more so this spring.
The Strand & Cheapside do not equal Broadway, with its hundreds of
omnibuses passing you in an hour. What would not this country be without
the dead weight of slavery. Theodore Parker’s speech was an admirable
political economy contrast between N. York & Virginia. As States every
thing, save soil & climate is in favour of the North, but the
Slaveholders draw to themselves whatever riches may be in the country, &
hence personally have wealth & power.”
