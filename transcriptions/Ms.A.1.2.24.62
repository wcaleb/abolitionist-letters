Pugh to H. Webb

“… We are sure of your full sympathy & interest in the late scenes in
Boston so graphically commented upon by ‘Parker’ in his sermon, which
you will not fail to read. … Yet there is a difference in our views of
this. I am just now told that H. C. Wright at a Mtg. of the colored
people last evening, urged {u}them{/u} ‘to plunge the knife to the
slaveholders heart, though {u}he{/u} could not do it.’ Strange teaching
this!“
