**[1854, 07-28] Ms.A.1.2.24.92**

Gerrit Smith to WLG; House of Representatives

“Perhaps, you were flattering yourself, that Congress is fast becoming
Garrisonian. If you were, you will learn your mistake, when you learn,
that only 45 voted, this morning, for Mr. Eliot’s motion to suspend the
rules that he might bring in a Bill to Repeal the infamous Fugitive
Slave Act. 120 voted against it.”
