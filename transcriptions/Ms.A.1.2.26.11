McKim to RDW

Urges him to write more often for the *Standard*. “To [Fremont’s]
election the Disunionists, of {u}this State{/u} at least, will make no
especial opposition. They will maintain the ground which consistency
requires of them but I presume they will wish well to the Republican
candidate as the best man, and will speak & act accordingly. The
election of a man who could & would use the power of his office against
Slavery would {u}perhaps{/u} supersede the necessity of disunion, or
perhaps would bring about disunion by driving the South off. The failure
to elect him would certainly greatly impair if not destroy the hold the
Union still has upon the loyalty of the North. The next Presidential
election,--which takes place in November,--will I think determine the
question of dissolution. I for one am desirous that the Northern part
should succeed. We would then know whether anything could be done in
that way, or nothing. Seward would be preferred by Anti-Slavery people
to Fremont but he would not be so likely to succeed. He is a man of
transcendent ability, but is not popular.” Gives reasons Fremont is a
good candidate. “If he’s run I hope he’ll be elected; then we shall see
what we shall see. In all this I speak only for myself. What Garrison &
the other [sine quibus non?] think I don’t know. These are merely my own
uninspired speculations. Don’t tell Mrs Chapman or put them in the
Advocate!—The ‘Underground’ is becoming a great institution. We had 23
arrivals last week, all within the space of 48 hours.”
