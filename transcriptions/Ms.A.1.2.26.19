McKim to RDW

Enjoyed his latest article for the *Standard*. “I was interested in what
you say of the Russian war, & John [illegible]; for although we have had
a great deal of writing from well informed people on both of these
subjects, one likes to know what one’s friends think & have to say on
such topics of general interest & discussion.” Updates on Vigilance
Committee activities. “I have been walking up & down today, with teeth
set, clenched fists, & my blood raging. Charles Sumner has been brutally
attacked in the Senate Chamber, felled to the ground, & murderously
beaten. I send you a paper, giving an account of this dastardly & brutal
affair. Its effect can not but be to arouse the North from its
supineness. It will hasten the crisis. The plot thickens. The end is
coming. Read the news from Kansas. We are on the eve of great events. I
don’t mean to say that a revolution is at hand; but one is approaching.
Let it come, I say, & the sooner the better. Let convulsions seize our
body politic & let the Union be blown into ten thousand fragments,
rather than this enslavement of the black race at the South & all races
at the North should longer continue.”
