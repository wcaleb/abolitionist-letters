Subscription matters. “We cold Northerners are getting our blood up …
[There is] an indication of a growing spirit of resistance to the South.
A private fact here in this city is an indication of the same sort, & a
fact of more consequence—viz. a determination among wealthy business
men, men of the world, non-abolitionists to raise $100.000 to send aid &
arms to the Free States men of Kansas. The condition of things there is
the most hopeful thing for the cause & the Republic that has been seen
since the battle of Lexington. Pierce is taking precisely the right
course in making the difference one between the Federal Govt. & the
people of Kansas. If U.S. troops drive any Northern man out of the
Territory, it will be as good a thing for the cause of liberty, as when
the British troops drove the Yankees from Bunker’s Hill;--& a better
thing if they can’t do it.”
