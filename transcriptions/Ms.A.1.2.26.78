McKim to RDW

“I regard disunion as inevitable. No activity on the part of the
abolitionists will be required to bring it about, and none on the part
of anti-abolitionists here in the North can prevent it. The one may
hasten & the other may retard the event, but it will come whatever may
the course of parties in regard to it. Look at the matter for a moment:
the North & the South are so diverse in character as to constitute
distinct though as yet not separate nations. In spirit, institutions,
habits, & inmost respect, in interests, they are antagonistical. There
is no real union between them at this moment, but on the contrary there
is a mutual repulsion which is every day growing stronger & stronger.
The causes which have brought about this state of things are at work
still, only with more activity & to a greater extent, and the time when
they will cease to work no one pretends to foresee. North & South there
is an acknowledged disaffection to the Union which every one sees is
rapidly on the increase.” McKim is certain disunion will come, even if
he is not exactly sure what form it will take. “I have seen a great deal
of Mr Sumner since he has been in Pennsylvania. He has been a frequent
visitor at this office, & I have seen him in company & elsewhere and the
more I have seen him the more I have admired him. There is a little
egotism about him which at first impresses one unpleasantly, but this is
a very small matter compared with the many noble & beautiful traits
which one finds on further acquaintance to be characteristics of his
nature.” Looks like Fremont will be defeated. “The Republicans now
acknowledge that we have the correct philosophy: that is that the first
thing to be done is to enlighten & convert the people. That accomplished
they see that everything else is easy. Wherever we have gone before they
find it easy to follow; where we have not opened the way they make no
progress.”
