McKim to RDW; Philadelphia

Praises the *Advocate*. “It is true that much of what it contains is a
reprint of what had previously appeared in American journals, but that
is necessary in the nature of the case & does not materially impair the
interest of the paper in the eyes of its cis-Atlantic readers. On the
contrary it is a satisfaction to see our articles come back to us
endorsed with your approval. Like the echoes of Killarney our utterances
are thus returned to us with increased force & sometimes added volume.”
