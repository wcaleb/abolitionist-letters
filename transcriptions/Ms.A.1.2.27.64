“Does India so absorb you that you have no time to think of us this way?
If you care to know I assure you we are worthy just now of
commisseration [sic]. The commercial pressure which is weighing us down,
is producing a very widespread distress, & the labouring people of this
country are to see, I fear, this winter much poverty & want as were
never before known on this side the Atlantic. From the last accounts
from England you do not seem to understand the condition of things here.
Perhaps the slippage of some of our large R. Roads, chiefly owned by
you, will open your eyes.”
