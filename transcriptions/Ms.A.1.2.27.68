McKim to RDW

Refers to long break in their correspondence. “… business is at a dead
lock, and every body feels poor. Such times have never before been known
here, in any day. I fear too that it will be no better with you. Perhaps
you are now in the midst of just such a panic as has been sweeping over
this country. Poor England, I pity her. If you can stand this trial; if
with mutiny to contend with in the East, and bankruptcy in the West she
can still calmly maintain her poise she will prove herself entitled to
all the praise her admirers have claimed for her. … Kansas is bound to
be a free state, Buchanan and the Border-ruffians to the contrary
notwithstanding. The President has done every thing in his power for the
slaveholders, but the power of the Free State men in the territory was
inevitable, and Governor Walker the President’s Satrap has been
compelled to give judgment in their favour. … So you see affairs in that
quarter look well.” Also thinks the hard times will work to
abolitionists’ benefit by making people more reflective and less
materialistic. “As for the fugitive slaves, their number is legion; they
flock through in half-scores. We have now 11 on hand to provide for &
the cry is ‘{u}Still{/u}, they come.’ [I] have a letter from Thomas
Garrett telling us that 28 about whom we are anxious are as yet safe.
28!! at one lick! … We are labouring at the crank of public opinion, and
at the rate we are going on hope to get it round. The wheel is turning
with an increasing momentum.”
