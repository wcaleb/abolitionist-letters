Theodore Parker to WLG; Boston

Farewell letter. Thanks him for his kind note; wishes to take his hand
once more before leaving. “I knew {u}you{/u} long before you ever heard
of me, & often heard you speak—never without instruction & admiration.
The men now living have done N.E. & the North great service. They are
quite unlike but all are soldiers in the same great cause. Wm L.
Garrison, Horace Mann, & R. W. Emerson. You took the most dangerous &
difficult part, & no soldier ever fought with more gallant [illegible].”
… Printed in Garrison and Garrison, 3:481, according to handwritten note
on letter.
