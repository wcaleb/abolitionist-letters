“British Subject” to WLG; Boston.

Contains some excerpts from a Canadian newspaper on Brown. One reads:
“It does not seem possible to understand why Brown could not have been
punished as the English and Irish traitors were, by imprisonment. What a
glorious martyr Smith O’Brien, the {u}par excellence{/u} respectable
agitator, would have been, had the English Government been silly enough
to hang him. He deserved hanging just as much as John Brown. But O’Brien
lives, as Mitchell, [the sham patriot] does, to make himself ridiculous
and even contemptible.” The pseudonymous writer who encloses these
excerpts hopes for the secession of the South states and the union of
the North with British North American provinces.
