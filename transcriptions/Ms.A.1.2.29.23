Pillsbury to EPN; Boston

Talks about how dearly attached to them he is, and how he regrets having
gone to the Continent while abroad, which deprived him of more time with
friends. “Since coming home, I have learned how dear you all are to me.
But I did not know before.” Is not surprised that the Republican Party
hasn’t been any better than he expected; especially singles out Henry
Wilson’s compromising speech in the Senate, delivered “with the unwashed
blood of Sumner almost steaming at his very feet!!” Praises Wendell
Phillips, notes his popularity on the lyceum circuit. More lines about
what a great time he had at her home and elsewhere. “How few such as
Eliza Wigham it would require, to save the world. And yet, where shall
that few be found?”
