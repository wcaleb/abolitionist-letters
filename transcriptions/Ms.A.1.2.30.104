McKim to RDW; Philadelphia

He is organizing an annual meeting, plans to invite Pillsbury. Garrison
and Phillips are better in the sense that they seldom have to be excused
or corrected for saying extreme things like Pillsbury. But McKim thinks
that the *Tribune* got the better of Phillips in an exchange on
Lincolnâ€™s bill for abolition of slavery in D.C. McKim has two John Brown
relics: a chip from the gallows, and a nail from his coffin. He also
sends an autograph.
