“The storm seems to howl more fearfully than ever; but it is a comfort
to have it raging where the world can see & understand. Hitherto we
could not make our cause comprehended. What slavery was as a political
institution, & how it {u}ruined{/u} the nation & destroyed individual
worth, while outraging & embruting [sic] millions, could never be shown.
Now, the South is showing, herself, what we wished to have known—in vain
for so many years. It is like the ‘debaclement of the [Neva?]’ in the
fine comparison of Victor Hugo. All is obstruction the night before—the
ice is gone & the river open the next morning. I think the solution of
it must be {u}dis{/u}solution. The South is every where threatening so
loudly to secede, & insisting on such enormous & {u}impossible{/u}
concessions from the North as the price of her remaining, that, supple
as the North has hitherto been, she {u}cannot{/u}, it seems to me, stoop
so {u}much{/u} lower beneath the Slaveholding lash.”
