**[1860, 12-14] Ms.A.1.2.30.171**

Susan B. Anthony to WLG; Peterboro

Talks about organizing of an Albany convention in upstate New York. Is
working with Pillsbury, May, Gerrit Smith, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
Smith “is in fine health & spirits now, & feeling very strongly that all
the genuine abolitionists should meet together & work together. … His is
a strong force added to our New York army—his last speech was on the
Constitution, and neither Aaron or I could dissent from one single
position or point. He is in entire sympathy with us, in wholly & totally
repudiating citizenship, admits the slave clauses. … I have just
returned to my room from a pleasant talk in the parlor with Mr. Smith.
He will go to Albany, & he wants Mr. Phillips to go before our
Legislature with him on the Personal Liberty question. In talking over
the probable results of the times, prospects of entire desertion of all
the weak & hesitating, the Republicans utter abeyance to their tyrants,
& only the few genuine abolitionists left, he said, ‘Well, {u}one{/u}
good, at least, I trust will come of it all. All of us earnest
abolitionist will be drawn together, we shall in the trial hour, forget
all & every thing, save the slave, and right heartily, strongly &
vigorously, work together.’”
