McKim to RDW; Philadelphia.

About McKim’s habit of sending regular fresh daily papers to his
friends. “My thoughts have been much with friends on your side the water
during all their troubles, and having no time to write and desiring that
they should be kept informed of what was going on, and not wishing
myself to be forgotten by them, nor to be found wanting in attention, I
have been in the habit of sending them occasionally fresh daily papers.”
He explains that he doesn’t always read the papers before sending them,
so he did not know about the attack on Queen Victoria in one of the
newspapers that apparently offended Mary Estlin.
