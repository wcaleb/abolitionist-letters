McKim to RDW; Philadelphia.

Talks about the Baltimore Convention and discusses “the character of the
party.” It is rotten to the core. Its materials are discordant &
incongruous. Nothing has held it together this long but what Mr Calhoun
so admirably styled ‘the cohesive power of public plunder.’” Predicts a
split between the Douglas men and Southerners. Predicts Lincoln will win
the election. “Then we shall see what we shall see. It will indicate a
gain to our cause, and will itself be a gain. At least so I think.
Parker Pillsbury doesn’t think so; and Wendell Phillips would hardly say
so—on the platform. As for our cause, considered irrespective of
political parties, its progress is steady & irresistible.”
