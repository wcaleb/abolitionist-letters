Gerrit Smith to WLG

Regrets that he won’t be able to attend the anniversary of the AASS, but
trusts “that the smiles of Heaven will be upon your Meeting.” Hopes that
the meeting won’t be consumed with discussion of whether the
Constitution is proslavery. “Whether these [illegible] be or be not Pro
Slavery, so it is that the American people persisted in being
Pro-Slavery, until they thereby destroyed the nation. Destroyed it is
simply by being Pro-Slavery, and destroyed it is no less by the
Pro-Slavery of the North than of the South. I do not say that it is
destroyed beyond restoration. I hope it will soon be restored; & I am
sure it will be ultimately. [p] The people were infatuated enough to be
Pro-Slavery whatever might be the character of the Constitution. They
will not I trust be Anti-Slavery whatever its character. They sacrificed
the nation to save Slavery. They will now, I trust, sacrifice Slavery to
save the nation. If they fell below the Constitution before, I trust
that they are now willing if need be to rise above it. [p] There is one
point at which the meeting should in my judgment put forth a clear
defence of the ‘Garrisonian Abolitionist.’ His influence, especially in
the case of such a man as yourself or Wendell Phillips, is too important
to the Cause of Freedom that injustice should be allowed to impair it.
[p] The ‘Garrisonian Abolitionist’ was formerly a Disunionist, & is now
a Unionist; and hence he is charged with being inconsistent, or at least
with being a convert. He is however the subject neither of inconsistency
nor conversion. This nation, whatever it was in theory & in its laws,
was practically a nation of kidnappers—of monsters. The ‘Garrisonian
Abolitionist,’ despairing at last of its reformation, held that it ought
to be broken up. But such a change has taken place in the nation within
the last year that its reformation is no longer to be despaired of.
Moreover the reformation can be carried on far more hopefully in the
union than in the disunion of the States. Hence with all consistency the
‘Garrisonian Abolitionist’ is now a Unionist. There is a conversion. It
is however {u}to{/u} him & not {u}of{/u} him. There is a change. But it
is {u}around{/u} him & not {u}in{/u} him. [p] Whether he was right in
holding that the Constitution is Pro-Slavery is another & inferior
question. It is very inferior because be the Constitution Pro-Slavery or
Anti-Slavery, the people are equally bound to be Anti-Slavery. The
Constitution can bind none to be guilty of crime, can excuse none for
being guilty of crime. On the immeasurably greater question whether the
Nation was Pro-Slavery he was emphatically right. Whether it was so
hopelessly Pro-Slavery as he finally believed it to be is still another
question. I confess that I lacked but little of being as hopeless as he,
or in the [words?] but little of identifying myself with his policy & of
going with him for the breaking up of the nation. Surely it is better
for a nation to be broken up than to continue to wield its mighty
national powers to uphold a great crime. Surely the English or the
French nation had better be broken up than held together by the policy
of putting to [death] any [feeble-born?] chief. That however were a
small crime compared with the crime of crimes which stains our nation.”
