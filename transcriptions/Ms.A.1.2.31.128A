Joshua R. Giddings to WLG

Thanks him for his speech at the anniversary meeting and praises it as
in accord with his own feelings. “Although Lincoln has failed to come up
to what you and I think he might and should have done, yet he is honest
in his positions and will require time to reach our positions.”
