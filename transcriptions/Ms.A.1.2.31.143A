Condolences on his wife’s death. “Shall you ever come to America? I
wonder if we shall ever meet again under this sky? I seem to be always
too busy ever to cross again; yet I should like to see you all once
more. Keep a warm place in your heart for us. No mere difference of
opinion will ever divide us. Somehow in the end we shall see eye to eye;
& if not touch heart to heart.” Fond remembrances to all.
