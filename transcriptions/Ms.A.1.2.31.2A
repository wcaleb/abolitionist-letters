William Robson to WLG; England

“I see the work of Secession goes on bravely & I rejoice to see it. I
only hope there will be enough of manliness in the North to leave the
seceding states to go their own way to their own place without any
attempts at compromise on the one hand or any blood shedding on the
other. I confess I have not much fear of the fighting, because it is
quite clear to me that raising sufficient funds to Equip an army of 80
or 100,000 men would be impossible, and any smaller force would be sure
to be beaten in an armed contest between the states.” He can’t predict
what American abolitionists are going to do when secession is completed.
“Will you as our Anti Corn Law League dissolve yourselves as a Society
when you have freed yourselves & your national States from all
complicity with the abominable sin? Or if not what will you do?”
