James Haughton to WLG; Dublin

“The wonderful changes which have taken place in your country in the
public sentiment of the people, within the past six months, & the
rapidity with which one unexpected event follows on another, among you,
have awakened here, a universal feeling of interest in your proceedings,
& I may add, of deep regret in many a heart, because of the present
posture of your affairs. For my own part, I may say, that when the news
arrived, that something like a real determination on the part of some of
your Southern States to secede from the unnatural coalition,--I do not
call it union, for no real union ever existed between your free & your
slave States, but a chain, which had long bound you together, like two
snarling dogs yoked against their will,--reached us, I rejoiced
sincerely, for I felt that the day of redemption of the slave, was then
nigh at hand. I saw, in that circumstance, the realization of that event
so long demanded by {u}your{/u} section of the American abolitionists,
‘No union with slaveholders.’ It is true, the cry of secession came from
an unexpected quarter: from the South, instead of the North: but no
matter, I rejoiced at the near fulfilment [sic] of our aspirations; & I
said, the North will surely permit this secession to on in peace, for,
where no real union ever did, or ever can, exist, to fight for an idea,
will surely never enter into the heads of Northern men, particularly of
Northern Abolitionists. But events during the past four weeks, have
falsified my anticipations.” He is surprised that the *Liberator* and
*Standard* seem to support the war, since they have always stood on the
side of the peace cause. “It does not appear to me that your Northern
men in their seeming determination to coerce the South to keep the Union
intact, are influenced by any feelings of kindness towards the slave.” …
“I believe the true policy of the North is, to allow such of the
Southern States as please to do so, to secede quietly, to follow the
example of England in getting rid of all protective tariffs, & by
throwing open her trade to all the world, go forward in a career of
continual prosperity & happiness. War will assuredly blast these
pleasant prospects, perhaps for a long season.” … “If you allow the
South quietly to secede, you will get rid of all complicity with her
slave system, which is daily doing her more & more damage in the eyes of
the whole world …” He again reiterates that Garrison would give even the
slightest support to war as a means of emancipation.
