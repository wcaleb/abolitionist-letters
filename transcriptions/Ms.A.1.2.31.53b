Eliza Wigham to WLG

Thoughts are with Americans during this crisis. “We are exceedingly
anxious that you should maintain your height above all the lower
elements that are brought into the conflict. Your position has hitherto
been impregnable, because your conflict has been waged in implicit trust
on the Almighty arm. You have not trusted to carnal weapons, but have
discouraged their use & have prosecuted the moral warfare which has been
so mighty. We consider that your non-resistant principle … has been one
great means of your wonderful power to stand when assailed so bitterly
on every side & of your remarkable success. You have roused & kept awake
the whole nation & although the North has been so false to liberty
taking it as a whole, still you have hid the leaven & it has worked &
will work. And you have upheld the standard. Do not let it droop to suit
those who take the carnal weapons. … We are very sorry to read Wendell
Phillips’ speech & the tone of some of the Standard’s articles takes his
ground. They seem to confound the North with {u}freedom{/u} & the
preservation of the Union with {u}emancipation{/u}, for, as far as we
can judge, from this distance, as yet the slave has no place in the
thoughts of the thousands who, in the heat & novelty & imagined
patriotism of the movement volunteer to go forth to fight.” She thinks
even Garrison gave the North too much credit in a letter Thompson showed
her. Keeps urging him to stand firm on the higher moral ground of
non-resistance.
