Americans are running out of patience with much of the English press
about the War, Harriet Martineau’s letters in particular. “When she
speaks of European affairs she speaks of what does not much concern us,
and when matters on this side the water are her theme, she blunders. Her
late diatribes about the North and the tariff have been exceedingly
offensive. … I thank you for the kind word in your [illegible] of me in
one of your late letters, but I am not convinced of my error. I am not
unaware of England’s virtues or of our faults. It has been our business
and our policy to set forth both, and in the broadest possible contrast.
I think our mission in this respect has ceased, although it is evident
that if we were to continue it, we might count on the cooperation of our
friends on the other side. You British Abolitionists are more holistic
than me. That is, you show your [illegible] in a different way. We
critise and condemn our Powers that be, and hold them to the highest
demands of justice. Explanations, apologies, defences, eulogies we leave
to those who occupy a different plane. British abolitionists of the H.
Martineau school & downwards pursue a different course. I don’t include
you. Nor do I wholly exclude you. You are an abolitionist but a
{u}British{/u} abolitionist. Perhaps no more than I am an
{u}American{/u} abolitionist. I don’t know how that is. But you seem to
me to be [tender?] of England’s faults and fully sensible of ours.
Perhaps however I misunderstand you. But you see why I don’t want to add
even in my humble way to unpleasant feeling existing between the two
countries. There is an {u}universal{/u} feeling of soreness in this
country toward England, and it is not all wounded vanity on our part. It
is to an extent fully warranted.”
