William Robson to WLG; Warrington

“I shall not enter into American politics & warfare here. I have done so
to H.C.W. & I have no doubt he will acquaint you with my [illegible
phrase], which are certainly not in harmony with Northern views &
feelings at the present crisis. Of course it would be much pleasanter to
agree with you in your Expositions of American duty & policy, but our
views of just principles, & even existing facts are so very different
that this at present is impossible. Perhaps additional experience may
bring us somewhat nearer together in our public views.”
