Gerrit Smith to WLG

“I value highly your approval of my recent writings on the War. That I
find myself agreeing so well with the utterances of yourself & Mr.
Phillips is with me no small evidence that I am substantially right in
my views of the War.” Talks about how it is difficult for people in
their position to stand somewhat aloof from both North and South, but
they have hope that the cause of the North will become the cause of
truth.

May Jr. to RDW. Says May’s son has joined the Union navy as a paymaster,
to the chagrin of May and his wife. “I have no time to lament, here,
over the shameful policy of the President and Administration, in
censuring Genl Fremont. … ‘Tis a terrible blow to the Northern feeling &
interest in the war.”
