“… I believe in the virtue of England. I have faith in the goodness of
her people. But her ruling classes are selfish, and in this contest of
ours their selfishness is strongly appealed to. Their abolitionism is
sentimental and traditional. On the abstract question of human rights &
human duties involved in this controversy, they would be found in the
last analysis to be on the side of the slaveholders. Indeed many of them
already, without waiting for the last analysis, have substantially
ranged themselves in that side. This you admit. But this you did not
{u}seem{/u} to admit … But I don’t regret the little controversy that
has been going on between you and us—abolitionists on both sides of the
water. We understand each other better in consequence. We are now agreed
and that intelligently. I am glad you are alive to the inroads which
slavery has made on the influential circles of England. … This is no
local question. It concerns you almost as much as it does us.
Anti-Slavery efforts in England are not works of supererogation, or of
superfluous benevolence. They are needed for the welfare of the British
Empire. The triumph of the Slaveholders in the South would foretoken the
restoration of slavery to the British West Indies, and a return of
slavery ideas among the governing classes of England.” Defends leaders
in America who say this is not a war for abolition. What they don’t say
is that the war *won’t* end in abolition. “They know that it will; and
most of them rejoice that it will.”
