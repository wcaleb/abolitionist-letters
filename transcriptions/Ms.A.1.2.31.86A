McKim to RDW

The latest papers from England appear to make war between Britain and
the U.S. inevitable, but hopefully the public opinion in Britain will
change. It certainly isn’t true that U.S. is trying to pick a war with
Britain, and British statesmen should know how to distinguish between
anti-English demagoguery and actual political intention. “Our amazement
at the developments made, or which to us seem to have been made, on your
side, is indescribable. When, years ago, the secessionists boasted that
they would have English sympathy & support … we laughed at them.”
Northern people are universally disappointed in England. Abolitionists
held out longer in their belief in England. “But the last news staggers
us.” He is amazed even at how old antislavery friends are acting. Mary
Estlin tells Sarah Pugh that she most admires Pillsbury’s position, but
all he does is pass “censures of our government & people and prophecies
of evil from the course they are pursuing.” Estlin adds that Pease
Nichols and Wigham agree with her estimation of Pillsbury. He thinks
that Pillsbury’s denunciations are “overdone” and “are calculated to
confirm wrong impressions sought to be made in your country by people of
sinister designs.” English seem to desire the end of the Union. “We
abolitionists originally demanded and hoped to effect the abolition of
slavery in the whole country. After laboring unsuccessfully for this for
12 years we then demanded disunion, first that we might be excused from
participating in the evil, and second as a preliminary to general
abolition which we believed would follow. We never expected anything but
{u}temporary{/u} disunion. We knew that collision would come, then
abolition, and then we supposed re-union. But we are having all these
together. The [illegible] of Events favours us. We shall have what we
originally asked for, {u}the total abolition of slavery in these United
States{/u}; and we shall have it, {u}tho Earth & hell oppose{/u}!” He
reiterates that he still loves all his friends.
