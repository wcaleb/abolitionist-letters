Sumner to WLG ({u}Private{/u})

“You know that for some time I have been very sanguine that Emancipation
was at hand. Of course, I am pained by the impediments which I find in
the small ideas & little faith of men in public life. A courageous
earnest purpose would settle the question at once for all time. [p] But
our English question has a [point?] now which causes great anxiety.”
Signs “ever faithfully yours.”
