McKim to RDW

“I do not say that England is {u}hostile{/u} to us, though that is here
the general belief; but she is not positively friendly. This feeling of
unfriendliness, under present temptations, makes the danger of war
imminent; and none the less but all the more so, because good people
like you don’t so regard it. You don’t seem to be aware of the ravages
slavery has made upon English opinion. You understand the workings of
the system here but don’t seem to perceive its outcroppings among
yourselves. Slavery is a power in Liverpool; in Manchester; at your
clubs; in your aristocratic, political & dilettanti literary circles …
{u}& in Downing Street{/u}. … That you have not a very high estimate of
our country, government, statesmen, and of the state of feeling here in
regard to freedom & slavery is not much to be wondered at. Our
Anti-Slavery papers are not the source to go for {u}impartial{/u}
statements. Their business is to tell the truth; but not the truth
relatively, but the truth absolutely. … This country {u}compared with
our ideal{/u}, is desperately wicked & deserves as she is receiving
God’s penal judgements; but this country, relatively, in virtue,
intelligence, magnanimity, is without a peer on the face of the earth. I
say this deliberately, and hold myself bound by facts which admit of no
gainsay, from the candid & intelligent to prove it.”
