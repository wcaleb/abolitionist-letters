McKim to RDW

Talks about how difficult it is to have conflicts or differences of
opinion adequately discussed over the span of an ocean. “You express
surprise in not admitting the fact that the pro-slavery sentiment of
England, whatever may be the extent of its existence, is due mainly to
American influences. We on the other hand are surprised that you should
dwell upon this, as a fact of any pertinence to the point in dispute. Of
course we know and are ready to admit to the fullest possible extent the
culpability of American slavery in demoralizing European sentiment.” But
the issue is not the cause, but the extent of such feeling, which “you
think we overestimate, we think you underestimate.” … “You will have
noticed that on the subject of our domestic strife & our inter-national
dispute, the abolitionists here are all of one mind. The matter is so
plain, or seems so plain to us, that we are all of one opinion. You must
have noticed that on certain points you find yourself opposed not only
by the abolitionists of all classes on this side, but by many
enlightened people, abolitionists & others on your side of the water.
This does not prove I admit that you are wrong, but it is a strong
suggestion against the certainty that you are right. [p] I fancy that if
you were, in political principles, more of a democrat your views & ours
would more nearly accord on questions which now seem to divide us. The
distrust of the people your language implies seems to me the [{u}proton
pseudos{/u}?] to which is to be traced your divergence from what we
consider the proper view to be taken of our difficulties. … Our
cooperation heretofore has been one of the words that has bound the two
countries in amity. *Esto perpetua*. With love to your family I am yours
ever the same.”
