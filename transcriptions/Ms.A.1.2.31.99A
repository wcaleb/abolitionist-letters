McKim to RDW

Webb has said he thinks reunion dubious, but McKim disagrees. “I think
that the integrity of the country will be restored; both in the primary
and secondary sense of that word. I think that freedom will over-run the
whole country … and that we shall yet enjoy all the blessings to be
hoped for by a nation ‘exalted by righteousness’ and ‘whose God is the
Lord’! Truth is more potent than error; Freedom than slavery; God than
the Devil. This is a struggle between Truth & Error; not the less so
because not pure & simple. Other issues are involved; but before God;
and before the world, as it will be seen in the light of history, the
struggle between Washington & Richmond is a contest, pure & simply,
{u}between Freedom & Slavery{/u}; between the powers of darkness & the
powers of light; and the question of which shall conquer is not, to
those who thus regard it, in the least ‘dubious.’”
