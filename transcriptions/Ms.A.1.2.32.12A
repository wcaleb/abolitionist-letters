Abby Kimber to RDW. The dateline reads “The 131 Anniversary of
Washington’s birth day.”

“It gives me grief to find thee playing into the hands of the enemy! It
breaks my heart quite entirely, it does! To find even thee, so led away
by the wiles of the Devil, by whom we are so sorely beset, as to
{u}believe{/u} that the N. Y. Tribune, edited by our own Sydney Howard
Gay (Greeley’s 1st Lieut.) and upheld by our own Oliver Johnson, could
be found false to the good cause! Why the ‘Father of lies’ himself,
would hardly hope to ‘deceive the elect’ in that matter! How wast thou
caught by the Fowles? … The noble meetings in England have been most
cheering to us, and to the Republicans. We are so very glad to see them,
as we have been sorely taunted by the Satanic press with the
indifference of your people, and the undisguised hostility of some of
the high officials in the Government of Eng. … [Union soldiers] are
gloriously contending for the ‘{u}promise made{/u} to our Fathers’ of a
government founded on the equal rights of all men before the law.”
Believes that old antislavery friends should stand by American
abolitionists, despite their imperfections.
