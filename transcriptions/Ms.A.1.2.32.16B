Thomas Vickers to WLG; Heidelberg, Germany

Vickers is apparently studying in Heidelberg. “However far removed from
the scene of the great conflict, I can not escape all its consequences,
and it would seem to me a species of cowardice to desire it. [p] In many
respects I should have greatly preferred remaining at home, but I have a
work before me—a work which {u}must{/u} be done, and the doing of which
will make me a part (however humble) of the spiritual power of the
American nation, and therefore I dare not neglect the preparation
necessary thereto. This is not an {u}excuse{/u} for being absent from
the country at such a time, but a {u}justification{/u} of that absence.
I could have shed my blood on the battlefield as well as another—perhaps
it does not require extraordinary courage to do that. I often think
there will be a work for the generation just coming on the stage of
action, calling for a courage scarcely less heroic than that which the
abolitionists have manifested during the last thirty years. At any rate,
if we are faithful, I am sure our path will not be strewn with roses. I
am sure that the Church must more and more resolve itself into the life
of the Nation. The ecclesiastical life of the people, and the national
or political life thereof, are not henceforth to be two separate and
distinct things—the nation must become a true {u}ecclesia{/u}, a real
kingdom of God—henceforth there can be no such yawning gulf between
religion and politics. … {u}If possible{/u}, I will write to the
Liberator. … I have an opportunity to see {u}all{/u} the principal
newspapers published on the continent every day. We have a very large
Reading Room here. The excitement in regard to Poland has in a great
measure withdrawn the attention of Continental papers from America. This
is fortunate for us, for they were stupidly in the dark in regard to our
affairs, and yet bound to give a judgment upon every event. [p] The
glorious uprising of the working people in England is a great joy to me.
I have always been satisfied that the {u}heart{/u} of the nation would
be with us the moment the case was understood.” He tells of addressing a
meeting of mainly working men in Yorkshire, and how they shouted down a
mill owner who tried to say a good word for the South.
