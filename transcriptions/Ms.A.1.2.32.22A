Philip P. Carpenter to WLG

“You see the war has done up our old unity of feeling. We kept to the
{u}old platform{/u}. Union a Cov. With Death. No Union with
Slaveholders. The North is now the Slaveholding & Catching Republic;
South {u}nominally{/u} free. Well if we can’t work together we must look
on & not fight with each other.
