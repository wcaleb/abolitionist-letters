Pugh to RDW

Of the trip to Europe: “That visit [to Ballitore?] is one of the very
bright spots in my memory.” Chatty news about the Draft Riots, E. M.
Davis’s assignment, Gettysburg and their decision not to leave the city,
efforts of friends to minister to fallen soldiers, etc. “The Anti
Slavery Office though not nominally the head quarters of the recruiting
Sergeant has had much to do with the filling up of the companies. This
is now considered Antislavery work, in a {u}certain way{/u}. Why not?
Good Non-resistant Lucretia Mott can act as chaplain!”
