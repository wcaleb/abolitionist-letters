Harriet Martineau to WLG

Has been edited for publication. Corrects what Martineau considers an
error in a recent *Liberator* which avers that John Bright “because he
has sprung from the industrial classes” will never be invited to join
“any Administration in England.” Martineau points out that Cobden “has
been invited & urged to take a seat in the Cabinet.” Also talks about
the industrial backgrounds of the Peels and Canning and Gladstone. This
passage crossed out by the editor: “The reasons why Mr Bright’s
political career is a failure, & why he has nothing more to expect, are
his disqualifications for statesmanship. Of these the most prominent are
his want of political knowledge, & his want of patriotism. His
narrowness of mind, his baseless political views, his passionate
prejudices, & his habit of reckless statement have prevented his
gathering any political force, & will always leave him solitary.” She
defends English political institutions, which reward desert.
