“This anti-slavery movement is assuming gigantic proportions, and, if
wisely & energetically conducted, as I trust it will be, will have a
powerful, and at the same time beneficial influence upon the counsels of
your public men. It will be of vital importance in this country. It will
teach a salutary lesson to our public men. It will mould the decisions
of our government. It will neutralise the poison diffused by our
journals. It will enlighten & stir up our ministers of religion. It will
create the anti-slavery sentiment of the new generation. ..”
