“If you think the enclosed remarks upon the prospects of our country
with regard to a future supply of cotton worth a place in the
{u}Liberator{/u} you are free to insert them. Since they were written I
have obtained much additional information confirmatory of their truth.
[p] I addressed a very crowded meeting last evening upon the subject to
which they relate & if I were to remain here I should take special care
to keep it alive. Its bearing upon the antislavery question you will
understand. I never had any beliefs in the efficacy of efforts in the
cause of free labour while we were so closely bound to the plantations
of the South but now that we are from sheer necessity drawn to look to
other lands for our supply I see that we are putting forth a mighty
power in the cause of Emancipation and I would do all I could to
increase the effort which is being made.” Encloses speech about other
parts of the world that can supply Britain with cotton.
