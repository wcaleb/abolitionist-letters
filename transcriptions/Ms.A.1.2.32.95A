Charles Sumner to HCW

Answers a query from Wright about whether, under the Administration’s
Reconstruction plans, the Federal Government will have to assume the
Confederacy’s debt. Adds, “I have never been fixed against compensation,
as a way of getting rid of slavery, on the principle of a Bridge of God
for the retreating fiend. But this is very different from a proposition
to pay for carrying on the war against it. The person who stands up in
Congress to make it ought to be photographed in the act, that mankind
may see precisely how he looks. [p] Meanwhile the good work proceeds.
{u}The end is certain{/u}. I wish I knew as well {u}when{/u} as
{u}how{/u}. But Slavery will disappear, & this land of ours will be
grand & glorious beyond any imagination to conceive.”
