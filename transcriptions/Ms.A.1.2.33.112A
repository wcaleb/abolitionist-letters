Supports Garrison’s position on the election. “You probably didn’t know
it, but I began reading the Liberator in 1835 or ‘6. I have never ceased
to read it with a profound admiration of its editor’s thorough devotion
to its grand specialty, though not, as no one knows better than
yourself, always accepting either the opinions or the measures it has so
ably maintained. And, since this infernal Rebellion broke out, I have
read the old, fearless, uncompromising [illegible] with an increasing
interest.”
