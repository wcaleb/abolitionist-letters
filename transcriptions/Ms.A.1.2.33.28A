McKim to RDW. On Freedmen’s Relief Association letterhead.

He has been intending for a while to write, but “I have not always been
in the mood to write to you. Indeed, to be frank with you, until lately
I have not been in the mood at all. [p] The pleasure of correspondence
between friends depends upon correspondence of views. When parties cease
to see eye to eye on questions of vital importance, then mutual
friendship will be best preserved by ceasing, after sufficient
ineffectual effort, to labor with each other. But correspondence, once
interrupted, like some other things, is not eas[il]y resumed; especially
when one of the parties, like myself, lives under a continual press of
writing duty which admits of no postponement. [p] The last I heard from
you was the other day through our friend Mr May. In answer to my
question: ‘Do you hear from R D Webb now-adays,--& if so what does he
say?’ he replied, in substance, ‘Yes; & he’s full of horror at the
conduct of the English Govt in the matter of Kagosima, &c &c’. I was
pleased to learn that the ‘line of communication’ between him and you
was kept open, and that the last [advices?] were so satisfactory. … To
my mind the abolition of slavery in this country is {u}un fait
accompli{/u},--the one thing remaining to be done being to recognize it
legislatively, and make provision for its consequences. All the powers
on earth & under the earth, could not restore the sceptreless system to
its lost throne. Believing this just as I believe that a hatched chicken
can never again be unhatched, I act accordingly. To those who regard
abolition as an event still in the future, contingent at that upon the
fidelity in the use of their old means [on?] its old enemies, a
different course is called for; and I let them pursue it. There is room
enough for us all. Mr. Phillips regards slavery as dead, but seems to
think that abolitionists must pursue it—in their organized
capacity—until the ‘aristocratic element’ which it has [caused?] shall
be eliminated from our political institutions, that is till the black
man shall be vested with the right of franchise. That is not my
judgment. I am in favor of universal suffrage, without respect to color;
but as a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, my work will be
accomplished, when the slave shall be {u}emancipated{/u}, and put in
possession of his {u}natural{/u} & {u}inalienable{/u} rights. I am a
democrat but not because I am an abolitionist. Abolitionism tends to but
does not include democracy.”
