GT Speech to the U.S. House of Representatives and letter accompanying

Thompson tells how he was escorted by Representative Pierpont and the
Vice President to the Capitol, where he met “Mr. Lincoln who gave me a
hearty greeting and accompanied into the House taking a seat immediately
in front of me. … My emotions were very strong on rising but my
embarrassment wore off as I proceeded. … When I mentioned the names of
yourself & Phillips the applause was loud and general. The name of John
Brown was loudly cheered.” Lincoln invites him to the White House.
