Francis William Newman to WLG; London

Urges Garrison to speak out against General Banks’ measures in
Louisiana. Criticizes the incompleteness of the Emancipation
Proclamation for leaving Tennessee and Louisiana exempt. He thinks
Lincoln has for the first time given national protection, rather than
merely local, to slavery. Garrison’s seeming approval of Lincoln’s plan
for reconstruction in Louisiana disappointed Newman immensely.
