Gerrit Smith to WLG; Peterboro

Is dismayed to see that the *Liberator* is in danger of discontinuance
and forwards $1000 to keep it afloat. Is sorry to see divisions over
Lincoln. “It is no crime to vote for him. All of us should be eager to
vote for him, if voting for him instead of another, shall seem most
likely to keep a disloyal man out of the Presidency. … For one I am too
much absorbed with the purpose of putting down the Rebellion to
consider, ere it be absolutely necessary to do so, whom I ought to vote
for. I am an Abolitionist. … But, during the Rebellion, I vote for the
man, call him Abolitionist or Anti-Abolitionist, who will do all he can
to suppress the Rebellion. … I am well aware that by this course I have
lost the confidence of many Abolitionists. Their philosophy differs
widely from mine.”
