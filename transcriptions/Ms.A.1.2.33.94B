Francis William Newman to WLG; London

Apologizes if he has been too harsh, but he deprecated Garrison’s role
in creating division in the ranks and believes it was right to criticize
Lincoln as long as he was contending with other candidates. “If I were
an American voter, I should unhesitatingly give vote & interest & voice
& pen now to Mr Lincoln, against any candidate who would accept other
terms from rebels than unconditional submission initiated by themselves,
as it were on their knees. But I would, at the same time, implore all
who love the Union, and wish the war to be succeeded by true, sound
peace, in which every State shall be loyal, to continue vigilant &
suspicious of the administration, until it preaches the political
[“political” inserted by carrot] equality of human races as a doctrine;
and shows its sincerity by treating all citizens as citizens, whatever
their colour. [p] I am not a doctrinaire Democrat for America any more
than for England. It is not for me to play the politician, & dictate
what forms of government are best; but, as a morality, I say strongly, &
if necessarily sternly, that you must not abandon your coloured citizens
to local oppression, not allow colour to be in any sense of political
import, unless you desire a renewal of God’s terrible chastisements. …
You will, I am sure, not be displeased, that I regard the future of the
human race now to depend more upon the United States than on
England:--so have our aristocracy chosen to have it, when they might
have led the world:--therefore it is that I assume all brotherly
freedom, as though I were one of your citizens.”
