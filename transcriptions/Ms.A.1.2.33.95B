S. Alfred Steinthal to WLG; Manchester

Writes to give his testimony in behalf of the Union as an Englishman.
“We earnestly long to see the South taught this great lesson, that the
nineteenth century cannot bear the establishment of a government based
upon a denial of all human rights to the producers of wealth, that its
very political economy revolts against the scheme.” Once “your nation,”
which is “blessed by natural advantages such as are possessed by few,”
frees itself of “the only burden which fettered your progress,” it “will
become indeed a ‘model Republic,’ and lovers of true freedom will look
across the Atlantic with rejoicing spirit to wish you Godspeed in your
path.”
