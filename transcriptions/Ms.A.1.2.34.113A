Pugh to EPN

She is so grateful for all the help from English friends during the
movement. Expresses “the great pleasure the sight of they well-known
hand gave me in Miss Estlin’s envelope; how pleasantly it took me back
to the time we first me, & our ‘joy & rejoicing’ in thee as one who
could accept us in good faith, & support us with unshrinking fidelity,
also to those bright days at Ben Rhydding; the walks, the drives, the
cosey evenings, when W. E. Forster stood & talked the late hours away.
With how much interest we watch his faithful course in Parliament.”
Mentions the marriage of Wendell P. Garrison and Lucy McKim and
impending marriage of Fanny and Henry Villard.
