McKim to RDW. “The difference & violent collision of opinion” between
Phillips and Garrison is “one of the most painful occurrences in our
Anti-Slavery history.” He traces the origins to the 1864 presidential
election. He had hoped that they would come together again after the
assassination, but they did not. Garrisonians said the proper work was
to help the freedmen. “‘That is to be done,’ said Mr Phillips by giving
them the ballot, not cheap ‘soup & primers.’ ‘We demand for the black
man the ballot, land & equal rights before the law.’ ‘So do we,’ I
replied ‘& while demanding it of the Government, {u}we give
him{/u}—without waiting for the Government, as far as we can,
{u}land{/u}, {u}education{/u} and all the practical advantages of
freedom possible.’ ‘You don’t go the right way to work—you put the cart
before the horse,’ said Mr Phillips. ‘I hope on to the old society &
agitate.’ ‘We do go the right way to {u}work{/u}’ we respond, ‘we
abandon the old society & {u}demonstrate{/u}.’ …” He is not blindly
following Garrison. “Mr Garrison was right in his judgement of Mr
Lincoln, but he perhaps spoke too highly in his praise; I think him
right in his judgement of Johnson, but I think he speaks too strongly in
his condemnation.” His recent speech on Johnson should have been more
measured.
