Jacob Bright to WLG; Manchester

Letter of introduction for Edward Cross. â€œWith respect to your public
affairs, I have rejoiced that you have been able to support President
Lincoln & at the same time I have not dared to condemn the course taken
by Wendell Phillips though I cannot sympathise with it. Has he felt it
necessary to urge on the government knowing that there were those who
held it back?
