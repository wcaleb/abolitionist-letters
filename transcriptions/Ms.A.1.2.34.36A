Says that the freedmen’s relief movement is not just an “{u}old clo’{/u}
movement” designed to relieve physical needs and educate. “It is a
reconstruction movement. It is to reorganize Southern society and that
on a basis of impartial liberty. It is to remodel public opinion in
regard to the black man by fitting him for & putting him into his place.
It is a movement established & conducted in the interests of
civilization.”
