Pugh to RDW

Has been reading Theodore Parker’s biography and is struck by the
resemblance between a picture of Parker and Webb. Takes for granted Webb
has also read the book. She is grateful “that I knew you both.” In
reading about Parker’s religious struggles she is more and more thankful
for her Quaker training, “seeing what loads of rubbish these strong
minds had slowly to clear away, ere they came to the simple doctrine of
the ‘Inward Light.’” Hopes the Dublin fortnightly meetings continue.
“Social life is a great means of culture for heart & mind & if in some
way lifted out of the every day routine of thought & care there is
enlargement & growth. Our young folks here have felt this in their
social meetings to work for the soldiers & the freedmen. These objects
will in time pass away.” She once looked forward to having Webb come
over to the U.S., but things have changed since the early days of the
cause and now she wonders if “we have not now wherewith to draw our
Transatlantic friends to us.” She has not heard from Webb since March
1864.
