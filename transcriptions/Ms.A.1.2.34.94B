Mary Carpenter to WLG; Bristol

Congratulations on the course of events. She didn’t write during the war
because she didn’t want to annoy her correspondents. She didn’t have
faith in the antislavery goals of the North, which seemed to care more
about the Union. But she has never abated in her interest in the cause.
“I congratulate your country.”
