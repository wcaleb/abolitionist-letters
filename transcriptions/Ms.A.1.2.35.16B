Chamerovzow, Louis Alexis, to WLG; London.

“I see that you have been appointed as a Delegate from the American
Anti-Slavery Society to the inter-national Conference to be held in
Paris. I greatly rejoice at the prospect of meeting you. ... I confine
myself in this letter to expressing my own gratification that you have
been selected to represent a Society which owes its existence to you, &
which has done much noble work. I would add a word of deep regret that
it has not been my good fortune sooner to have an opportunity of saying
how much I deplore the causes which in the past, & under certain malign
influences, tended to estrange men who, working for the same end, ought
to have been united in modes of action as they were in sentiment. Let me
be permitted to hope that the future may be more auspicious. ... George
Thompson knows me well; so does Miller McKim. Both will, I am sure,
reply for my sincerity.”
