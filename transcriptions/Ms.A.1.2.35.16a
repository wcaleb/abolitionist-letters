Printed circular on the “Paris Anti-Slavery Conference.” Notice of
postponement to August 26 and 27. The postponement notice, dated April
5^th^, 1867, notes that “many persons in the United States, and other
distant countries, are likely to visit Europe during the Paris Universal
Exhibition. It is submitted that advantage might be taken of this
circumstance to appoint some of these persons as Delegates, and it is
hoped the friends of the cause will make an earnest effort to impart to
the Conference the character of an international Anti-Slavery
representative assembly.” [On the back is the original invitation,

DEAR SIR,

The Committees of the BRITISH AND FOREIGN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY and the
SPANISH ABOLITIONIST SOCIETY, (LA SOCIEDAD ABOLICIONISTA ESPAÑOLA,) have
agreed to a suggestion made by the “COMITÉ FRANÇAIS D’EMANCIPATION,” to
hold in Paris, during the Great International Exhibition, a Conference
of the friends of the Anti-Slavery cause. ...

It is proposed that this Conference should comprise representatives from
Brazil, England and the English Colonies, France and the French
Colonies, Holland and the Dutch Colonies, Haiti and St. Domingo, the
African Republic of Liberia, Portugal, Spain and the Spanish Antilles,
Venezuela, and the United States of America. Its immediate object is to
take cognizance of the actual state of the Anti-Slavery question in
these countries, and to consider what further means may be adopted to
promote the final abolition of the Slave-trade and Slavery.

It is hoped that representatives from Chile, Peru and Mexico, and
Travellers [sic] and Missionaries from Africa may be present. ...

On behalf of the Committees of these Societies,
