GT to WLG.

Brief personal note. But in the same folder is a letter from Lyman
Abbot, Gen. Sec. of the American Freedman’s Union Commission, dated 6
May 1867, expressing his gladness that WLG will represent the Commission
in Paris, and promising to forward a good report on the progress of the
Freedman’s cause for presentation at the Conference.
