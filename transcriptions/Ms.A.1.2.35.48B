McKim to RDW. On American Freedman’s Union Commission letterhead. Talks
about a misunderstanding between himself and Eliza Wigham after he wrote
an impetuous letter acknowledging receipt of her donation. “I am sorry
to suffer in the estimation of one whom I have so long honored & loved,
but I can do nothing to help it. People separated by time & space,
working at the same object from different points of view & through
different media must of necessity misunderstand each other sometimes.
And when they do the less said the better.” The sticking point seems to
be a difference of opinion on the American Missionary Association.
Wigham has criticized quarrels between AMA and [the Freedman’s Union?]
and the old Garrisonians. McKim criticizes the AMA and says the “ablest”
men are on his side.
