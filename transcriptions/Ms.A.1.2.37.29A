Emilie Ashurst Venturi to RDW; Copy

Her grief over the death of Mazzini; thanks for Webb’s sympathies. Is
disgusted by the ostentatious funeral that the Italians gave him, when
they had so long neglected and cast him aside, and is horrified at plans
to petrify the corpse. “I am sure you will feel with us: and I am sure
you will forgive my silence.” She and her sister have been quite sick
with sorrow. “My guiding star is gone out and I feel to be in dark
night. When my Carlo died, Mazzini said to me ‘Now dear, you must try to
live, as I do, for barren duty,’ but while there was his angelic smile
of approval for every little effort, life could not be quite barren—now
his words are terribly true.” She knows Webb “love and honoured him as
he deserved, and so must have wanted to know all, though that all is so
bitter.”
