A.G. Weld to EPN. Is pleased with the prospect of the WASC.

“What a curse have Civilised nations invariably been to the barbarians
among whom they they [sic] have settled – what a hissing & a by-word
must we be among the heathen! Look not only at India, but look at the
World – Have we not always robbed the ignorant & the defenceless of
whatever we wanted. In Africa we wanted men, so we organized a regular
system of war, kidnapping, & plunder in order to get what we wanted – In
South America we wanted {u}gold{/u} & {u}silver{/u} and {u}precious
stones{/u} – here too we resorted to violence & blood. In No America we
wanted {u}land{/u} – and here we had recourse to extermination, fraud,
persecution, force & fear – rooting up the Aborigines from the land of
their fathers & casting them headlong into their graves, or driving them
beyond the Rocky Mountains in the midst of cold & hunger, nakedness &
disease & death – In Asia we wanted {u}revenue{/u} – there heavy
taxation was resorted to – and who can paint the horrors which have
followed the Conq[u]eror’s [ear? car?], {u}wherever{/u} civilized man
has set his foot upon the soil of the Savage, & planted the standard of
his Christian sovereign. ... I often feel, like thyself, ready to
despair of my Country – ready to believe that, notwithstanding all the
moral effort which has been put forth on behalf of the slaveholders of
the South, thy {u}will not{/u} repent, and that deliverance to the
captive will at last come in terrible judgment. [next page] I rejoice in
the prospect of the World’s Convention to be held in England next Spring
– What a deeply interesting & important meeting it will be! What a
privilege to be there, & in all probability thou wilt enjoy it.”
