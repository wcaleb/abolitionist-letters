[Quote from Judge Jay:] “East India reform seems to me to be not merely
practicable but of easy accomplishment. ... Whenever East India cotton
shall either drive the slave cotton from the European market, or greatly

be felt and acknowledged the moment it ceases to be lucrative. [p] The
friends of East India reform may be assured of the sympathy of every
real philanthropist, and especially of every American abolitionist.”
