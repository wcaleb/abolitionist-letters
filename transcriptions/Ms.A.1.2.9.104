**[1840, 09] Ms.A.9.2.14.13**

EPN to “My dear friend” (MWC?). Discusses American abos in Britain.

[Seeing mutual friends?] remind me of thy desire to have a few of Dl
O’Connell’s autographs for your fair. Truly gratified do I feel in being
able to fulfil it, to some [?] extent – It was my good fortune to be in
his company more than once last week -- & he kindly wrote me thirteen
cards, two of which I enclose to thee – he is the most good natured,
kind hearted person you can conceive -- & I hope I may at some future
time be able again to avail myself of his kindness, for your benefit.
[p] O’Connell most generously left his urgent engagements in Ireland
last week, to attend a meeting here on behalf of British India – “the
most important question” as he styles it in his speech, which he has
ever advocated, & he promised to come again before [parliaments?] to
give the cause another help.
