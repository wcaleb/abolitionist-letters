NPR to RDW; [Concord, N.H.] Discusses return to New England. Wishes that
RDW would come by the next steamer.

“The gallant Steamer beat her way against the combined opposition of
wind & sea, for the wind blew in her teeth nearly all the way after
clearing the south cape of dear Old Erin. It was very grand to witness
the struggle of the 450 horse Power with the terrible Ocean. ... Boston
showed small to us, impressed as we were with the magnificence of Dublin
Liverpool & Glasgow. But it was our native shore & on it were our dear
ones & our {u}Homes{/u}. ...

“I wish we could see you in New England. I should like to requite the
dear Dublin friends ... We could show you but a rough exterior here, but
we have glorious materials for reform & a magnificent opportunity of
turning the topsy turvy world upside down. The way is wide open here for
a grand millenial [sic] enactment. Neither church nor state here can
{u}legally{/u} persecute us unto death. And our [mule?] is greatly
[wonted?] to hear truth without rearing on its hind legs, within five
years past. Come & see us. The Steamer will cross by & by in {u}a
week{/u}.”
