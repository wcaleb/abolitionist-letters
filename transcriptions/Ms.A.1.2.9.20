**[1840, 03-16] Ms.A.1.2.9.20.**

MWC to EPN, Boston. Thanks EPN for letters and newspapers relating to
the British Indian question sent by her and G. Thompson. Thinks that the
Chartists should aid the British Indian reform movement. ... Compares
the treachery of Gerrit Smith, a Third Party man, with that of a member
of the British India Society.

“How many thanks do I owe both of you [GT and EPN] for keeping me
informed of your movements on this B.I. question. One so interesting
from its very vastness alone that one would think every human soul as
stamped with the infinite {u}must{/u} be drawn irresistibly to its
support. I see you are occasionally encountering the hostile feeling
that grows out of want of conviction that ‘our Country is the World –
our Countrymen all Mankind’ – as in the feelings excited in the minds of
the Chartists. If a feeling be raised in the midst of a people that is
striving for its own benefit which shall [cause?] that people to labour
for {u}others{/u}, the moral foundation is laid on which the
superstructure of their own claims can be erected. But while self is the
dominant idea, there can be no self-sacrifice, & without self sacrifice
no salvation. Therefore I lament that those who are striving for the
right of suffrage in England should not rejoice to see wrong abolished
in India, or should think that their own case would not be improved by
efforts to ameliorate suffering in any part of the globe. ... You
suggest to me the preparation of some thing which may aid {u}your{/u}
cause – {u}our{/u} cause – the cause of British India. ...”
