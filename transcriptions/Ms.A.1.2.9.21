Birney, J. G., to WLG, New York. The AASS decided against changing the
date of the annual meeting, per the MASS’s request. The English
Abolitionists want some of the delegates to the World’s Anti-Slavery
Convention to be in London two weeks before the start of the Convention.

“It would doubtless, be an agreeable thing to those who purpose
attending the general Anti-Slavery Conference in London, to have the
opportunity, also, of attending our Annual Meeting. But it is not
considered by the Executive Committee a matter of prime importance –
inasmuch as the proceedings of our Society will be made known by the
earliest opportunity to the delegates in London.”
