Jackson, Francis, to [Jonathan Phillips?], Boston. Discusses William
Adam’s qualifications for the World’s Convention. Rough draft.

“You are perhaps aware that a Convention of the Friends of Universal
Freedom is to be held in London on the 12^th^ of June next, at which it
is expected ~~that~~ nearly every civilized nation in the world will be
represented ~~at it this meeting~~. The object is, of course, to compare
views, to communicate information, to devise ~~measures~~ modes of
action, and to animate the convictions & ~~labors~~ efforts of those who
are in different countries, acting against Slavery.

“The Convention is an {u}open{/u} one, ~~having no connexion with~~
bound by no creed or constitution, with the exception that ~~the call
restricts the~~ by the terms of the call no means of abolishing Slavery
are to be countenanced, which are not exclusively “of a moral, religious
and pacific character.”

It has been thought desireable [sic] that Mr William Adam of Harvard
University should be present at this meeting. He resided twenty one
years in India, under circumstances calculated to bring him in contact
with the laboring classes in nearly every part of that ~~country~~ great
empire. He has of course an almost unequalled amount of information
relating to the Slavery of Hindustan; that long oppressed country
[something illegible crossed out] where a ~~work~~ task is presented to
British philanthropy not inferior in importance and perhaps more arduous
than the work of West Indian Emancipation. [Adam feels a call of
conscience to present his report on the enslavement of Hindus before the
WASC.] ... The [inserted: “antislavery”] world will be represented at
it, & therefore any valuable information there given, will be shortly
after, brought before all the philanthropists [inserted: “& leaders of
public opinion, in”] Europe & America. [Encourages addressee to help
raise funds for his trip, because “we have had reason to believe that
you are far from indifferent to the [inserted: “universal”] cause of
freedom ...”]
