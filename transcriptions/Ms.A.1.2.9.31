Bassett, William to EPN; Lynn. Some people will be prevented from going
to the WASC by the business depression. EPN will meet Lucretia Mott.
Thanks GT for a bundle of pamphlets. Is surprised that the British
abolitionists do not support the British India Society.

“It [the WASC] will be an intensely interesting occasion and one which
must have an important influence on the cause of freedom throughout the
world. May you be favored with the presence of Him who alone can impart
wisdom to your counsels, that so your deliberations may tend to His
glory & to the welfare of His creatures.”
