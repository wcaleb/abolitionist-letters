Grimké, Sarah, to EPN; Belleville, New Jersey. Hopes that “some
providence” will prevent England from going to war with China. Is not as
enthusiastic about American Abolitionists as Harriet Martineau. ...
Criticised the Society of Friends in a document to be sent to the WASC.
A letter from J. Sturge has been published in the Emancipator, “in which
he mentions that a report has reached England that women will be sent as
delegates ...” SMG disapproves of the idea. Lucretia Mott is the only
woman she knows well, who is going to London.

“altho’ your nation seems [nearly?] bent on carrying fire & sword into
the peaceful Empire of China for the purpose of promoting a commerce as
destructive to human life & intellect as is the opium trade, yet we
cannot but hope that the great ruler of the Universe will interfere & by
some providence prevent them from perpetrating so black a crime – we
rejoice that the philanthropists of Great Britain are putting forth
their energies to rouse the justice & humanity of the people & try to
prevent their sharing in the guilt of such a war by granting supplies to
carry it on. ...

“In the Emancipator of this week a letter has been published from Joseph
Sturge in which he mentions that a report has reached England that women
will be sent as delegates to the Convention, we rejoice that he wrote it
& hope that it may meet the eye of such of our sisters as have been
appointed, we live so much out of the world (even the A.S. world) that
we were not aware of any intention to send women, but we have greatly
regretted it since we heard of it & hope the Lord will preserve them
from presenting themselves there in the character of delegates, it would
we apprehend be as J.S. remarks any think but a help – a discussion on
the subject is greatly to be deprecated – it is desirable & indeed all
important that nothing should be done to divert the attention of the
meeting from the great subject of human liberty which has called them
together.”
