Bradburn, George to Francis Jackson; Philadelphia. Discusses his
traveling plans. Hopes Garrison will go to the World’s Anti-Slavery
Convention. Names the steamers on which various Abolitionists are going
to London. Asks again for letters of intro {Particularly from Mr
Pierpont, “for he is acquainted all over Europe.”}

“I wish we had Garrison w/ the company. I know not whether to
{u}urge{/u} his going, or not – for you say it is somewhat doubtful if
he goes. He best knows where he will be most needed. But a Convention of
the Abolitionists of the World must needs be strikingly imperfect,
without the presence of Wm. L. Garrison. ... Some Abolitionists will
leave N.Y. on the 9^th^, in the Great Western (Mr. Norton of Conn. among
them, & perhaps Birney), some on the 13^th^, in the Stephen Whitney
(Stanton at least), and possibly some so late as the 1^st^ of June. ...
I also wrote Henry G. Chapman, asking him to call on Grotton, the
British Consul, for a letter to O’Connell.”
