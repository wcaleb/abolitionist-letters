Kimber, Abby, to EPN; Kimberton, Pa.?. Re: WASC. {Fears that her last
letter was lost on the {u}President{/u}. Muses on the dangers of sea
travel, which even though they are not greater than the thousand
accidents that happen by land, inspire gloom and a greater appreciation
of how much distance separates friends. Hopes that divisions will be
buried by the time of the WASC.}

“I hope that you may have {u}Mrs Chapman{/u} in England – how I should
enjoy being present ... and if the Phillips join her you will have a
lovely convention indeed – I was acquainted with Wendell Phillips and
Rogers only through the abolition papers, before we met in London – and
with Garrison only as an editor and public speaker – so thou see
{u}we{/u} amassed many treasures to be laid up “in the mind’s chambers,”
as Whittier tells Libby [Neall?]. Hannah Webb says, ‘the convention has
added amazingly to their subjects of thought’ – and so it has to ours –
we had anticipated the pleasure of forming acquaintances and
friendships, with {u}British{/u} and {u}Foreign{/u} – but that we should
so cordially adopt Garrison’s motto – Our Country is the World &c – was
more than I had thought. – so many whose company, we enjoyed in England,
rise up before us ‘like a band of brothers joined’ – that I cannot
recognise a ‘foreigner’ among you – But as to the Convention – as our
petty annoyances and mortifications fade from our minds the rejection of
our Delegates stands out in broader relief and mars more and more its
fair proportions – Yet I think it has done and is doing much for the
advance of the cause – And it serves to frighten the South so much that
they cannot [?] to examine its merits.”
