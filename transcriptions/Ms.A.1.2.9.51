**[1840, 06-13] Ms.A.1.2.9.51**

To [WP?] Praises the addressee for his protest against the exclusion of
female delegates from the “General convention.” Says “you and GT”
behaved nobly, so it must mean Phillips. Also asks after MWC and
Angelina Weld.

“But how has this great assembly degraded itself by the ungallant,
unjust and ungenerous resolutions not to receive the Delegates from
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania because they were females! I am heartily
ashamed of my countrymen.”
