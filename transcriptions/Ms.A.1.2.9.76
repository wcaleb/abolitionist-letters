Bangor [Me.] Female Anti-Slavery Society. “To Female Abolitionists.” May
1840. An appeal to English Abolitionists for aid. [With GT to Whom?,
dated July 20, 1840.]

[Printed circular on a piece of stationery with “Am I Not a Woman and a
Sister?” seal.]

“Ladies, We solicit your aid. Oceans may divide us, but the free spirit,
untrammelled by time or place, mingles with you and asks your sympathy
and cooperation. ... We implore your co-operation by assisting us in a
pecuniary manner. The Bangor Female Anti-Slavery Society, anticipate a
public sale the coming year, and we solicit donations in any manner most
agreeable to yourselves, feeling that we shall not appeal to English
hearts in vain. ‘Has not the Island Empress already arisen in her might,
and said to the foul traffic in human flesh! thus far shalt thou go and
no farther?’ We cannot appeal to you in vain, you are too nobly
conspicuous to fear it. [p] Through our personal friend, and authorized
Solicitor, Mr. C. Lennox Remond, we make known our wishes ... [Signed by
corresponding committee, Eliza Mason, Abba M. Moody, Julia Godfrey,
Bangor Maine, May 1840.]
