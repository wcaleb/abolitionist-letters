NPR to Parker Pillsbury; Edinburgh. Enthusiastic congratulations “on the
glorious victory of the 3^rd^ of June” – the casting out of New
organization. Account of London Conference. {For the Herald of Freedom.}

“From this glorious capital of Northern Britain I hope to send you & the
dear readers of our {u}dear{/u} little paper [Herald of Freedom] a word
of affectionate remembrance – I have not forgotten either for a day
since I left the shores of our beloved country – doubly beloved since I
have had opportunity to see the less free portions of our common earth.
Proslavery as she is our country is yet the freest land on the globe. I
tell them all so here & this is the way I “slander my country,” as our
poor brother David Kimball charged me as I was about leaving it. But it
is sweet to forgive him across the blue water, & the easier, because he
is {u}on the soil of that freest & noblest of all lands of the
earth{/u}. ... [“New organization”] is not confined to our side of the
water. We found it in full exercise here. The American type of it had
preceded us & we found it in ‘the full tide of experiment’ on our
arrival. It had transmuted our glorious ‘{u}World’s Convention{/u}’ into
a local conference of guests in attendance on a London Committee. We
found no such meeting as we were sent to & did not dishonor our
credentials or those who sent us by entering within its narrow
enclosures. Brother Wm Adam, Remond, Garrison & myself [quietly?] took
up our position without the camp. A full exposition will be given on our
return. Our friends may be assured of this that ‘the World’s
Convention,’ when it meets, must sit on the other side of the Atlantic –
or if on this, that it cannot be holden in London. There is not freedom
enough in England yet to comprehend so free an Idea. They say there that
‘the World’s Convention’ was only a ‘poetical flourish’ of ‘Whittier’ &
that the British & Foreign Committee never thought of such a thing! But
the Spirit of Reform has got foothold here and it lacks not advocates if
{u}George Thompson{/u} & {u}Daniel O’Connell{/u} & {u}Wm Adam{/u} are
competent to be such. [p] But though we did not enter the London
Conference, I think our voyage has by no means been in vain. Nor will
the Conference be in vain. Such a meeting had to be holden in Europe
preliminary to the gathering of Humanity. It has been holden – and the
spirits of Liberty here have seen that it was not the meeting of
Freedom. They are now ready to meet kindred spirits on the broad
unshackled platform of Human Brotherhood without distinction of Color,
sect, or {u}sex{/u} or clime.”
