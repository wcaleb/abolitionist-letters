Ashurst, William H., to WLG. Re: exchange of information.

[Has heard WLG plans to write an article on the Convention and the
woman’s question. He wants a copy so he can have it published in
pamphlet form in England. Asks for more detail in WLG’s request for
information concerning England’s poor laws. Asks for advice about which
American papers to subscribe to.]
