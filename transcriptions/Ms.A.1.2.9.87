Bassett, William, to EPN; [Lynn, Mass.] Refers to India question. Thinks
that the intolerance displayed at the WASC may have caused beneficial

reason for the exclusion of our delegates ...” (see letter to Mott in
the Liberator, re: Quaker sectarianism)

“We are somewhat disappointed at the results of the Convention – a
{u}World’s{/u} Convention we can no longer term it – but, the remote
effects which will proceed from it cannot be estimated – some of its
proceedings are exceedingly important in themselves – and may we not
believe that those acts which were conceived in a spirit unworthy of men
engaged in so noble a cause will be [corrected?] for good?” ... “We feel
nearer than ever united to the kindred spirits on your side the water,
and we shall anxiously look for tidings from you. Though an ocean rolls
between us, yet it interposes no barrier to a communion of spirit – we
feel that our cause is {u}one{/u} – that we have the same enemies to
contend with, the same high and holy influences to cheer us onward –
that our trials & our hopes are {u}one{/u}.” ... “Farewell, my dear
friend – though personally unknown, and ... separated in body, I feel
nearly united to thee in Spirit. I cannot express the satisfaction &
encouragement which they communications have afforded me.”
