Whittier to McKim

Declines invitation to the 20th anniversary meeting. In the twenty years
since the AASS began, “we have broken up the criminal apathy of the
nation. We have compelled the Church, which, at the commencement of our
labors, seemed utterly blind to the subject, to look at Slavery as it
is, until, with eyes open to all its enormities, it stands without
excuse before God & man. We have brought Freedom & Despotism, Light &
Darkness, Christianity & Heathenism, face to face, for the final
arbitrement of the great question between them. We have helped to make
up the issue, & hastened the long foreseen crisis.”
