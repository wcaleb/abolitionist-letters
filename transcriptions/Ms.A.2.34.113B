Henry Wilson to WLG

Congratulates him on the last issue of the *Liberator* and thanks for
his years of work. “… in reading the Last number I feel like parting
from a dear friend. It has deepened my love of equal Liberty, and my
abhorrence of Slavery, and its influence upon me will cease only with my
being. I part with it with mingled emotions of joy and sorrow.”

Edward M. Davis to WP. “[*On back of envelope is printed:*] *The
Massacre of St. Domingo was occasioned by an attempt to oppress those
made free by Revolution. The ballot box is the safety valve to prevent
insurrections.* [p] Do not trust to *State* enactments to SECURE the
ballot to the disfranchised at the South. ... *Before any of the
rebellious States are admitted*, make it the FUNDAMENTAL Law of the
NATION that no State shall put a ban on any one because of race, color,
or descent. [*Urges support for Amend.*] [*In the letter:*] Keep up your
courage my dear friend ... and you will succeed in saving the Country
from another revolution.”

May Jr. to RDW. Dissolution of AASS; Phillips’ conduct; Freedmen’s Aid.

“… For myself, I have had one opinion, & one faith, about it, for nearly
a year; it was, and is, that when the people of this country should
agree to place in their Constitution the Abolition of Slavery and its
Prohibition hereafter, thus rendering it illegal to hold a slave, &
taking from that wicked & oppressive relation all sanction, direct &
indirect, of law & Constitution, that it would not only be right &
suitable for the American Anti Slavery Society & its auxiliaries to
dissolve, but their duty to do so,--the anti-slavery work proper being
accomplished, antislavery principles being recognized, and incorporated
into the law of the land; & on the ground that it is incumbent on us, as
abolitionists, to recognize in such respectful way the Nation Act, and
accept it in its full, & obvious meaning & intent; & because, to
continue our association, in such circumstances, is to reject the
National act as hollow, and ineffective. Such ground {u}I{/u} shall not,
cannot take, for one. I rejoice and give thanks for the National Act,
abhorring & repudiating Slavery,--shall accept it to the full, and
rejoice that, in future, we must no longer work for {u}slaves{/u}, but
{u}for freed men{/u}, soon (I trust) to become, in all respects, the
possessors of every right of humanity upon our soil. … Now the
Freedmen’s Aid [work] looms up large—not ‘cheap soul & primers,’ as W.
P. called it, but a combined, concentrated effort of the conscience &
worth of the Nation to lift up the emancipated man, and secure for him
all his rights; a work which is by no means confined to, and limited by,
the ‘F. A.’ organization, but is recognized for {u}duty{/u},
{u}necessity{/u}, & the only {u}honest policy{/u}, by all that is good
and true in the land.”
