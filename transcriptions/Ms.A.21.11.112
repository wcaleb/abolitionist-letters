**[1840, 10-20] Ms.A.21.11.112**

Bourne, George, to A.A. Phelps. Discusses the upcoming November Chardon
Street Chapel Convention. Note says it was not received until after the
convention.

“The proposed assemblage of your ‘{u}Universal Reformers{/u}’ on the
third Tuesday, I believe, of November, has excited some solicitude; and
a wish has been expressed that those wiseacres shall be exposed as they
merit. They ‘most cordially invite all who have anything to say on those
vital topics, the {u}Church{/u}, {u}Ministry{/u}, and {u}Sabbath{/u}, to
utter the word that is given them, and especially those who hold the
prevalent opinions to give their reasons for the faith that is in them.’
[p] Some of our Brethren and Friends have urged me to attend that
meeting – they think that I might give those blunderheads some
“{u}notions{/u}” – and that they would take from me as a sort of
“{u}Incendiary Fanatic{/u}” some plain or even pungent truths which
would not be so acceptable from some others – and besides, that my
acquaintance with those topics would enable me collaterally to benefit
listeners, if I could not reform the would be Reformers of all except
themselves. ... I would speak upon every question, with the changeless
tone of old Cato’s ‘Defenda[?] est Carthago, so I would reiterate that
the Church is the light of the world, the Ministry the salt of the
earth, and as I told Garrison and Rogers, we have no more right to
question the authority of the Sabbatical Institution, than we have the
ordinance of marriage, or to inquire why we should masticate with our
mouths, instead of propelling food and drink into our ears and noses.
[p] If the suggestion of our Friends here meets your concurrence, write
me as speedily as convenient, that I may have time to search out some
Hebrew and Greek, with which to {u}bother{/u} the Universal DEformers!
