Tappan, Lewis, to A.A. Phelps; New York. At this point Tappan has
apparently heard from Phelps that AAP intends {u}not{/u} to go to
London?

“I recd yr letter this morning, and hasten to answer it before the mail
closes. I am strongly disposed, for one, to acquiesce in yr decision not
to go to England to attend the Convention 12^th^ June and simply for the
reason you give – after stating the case – “our cause will not suffer in
England so much without (you) as it will here.” Garrison is determined
to introduce the woman question in England. He avowed this at a meeting
in Mr Wright’s chh last evening. But Birney & Stanton understand it.
Could you have gone out simultaneously with W.L.G. and N.P.R. it would
have been very desirable. It would be worth a good deal, for you, who
were here during the whole proceedings, should be on the ground to state
the case fairly and to correct misrepresentations. But your letter
satisfies me that you can do {u}more{/u} good here. And then we shall
save the money! How easily men are persuaded to acquiesce in a course
that will save to them their pennies.”
