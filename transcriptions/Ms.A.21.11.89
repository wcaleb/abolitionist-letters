Scoble, John, to A.A. Phelps; Birmingham. Concerning the protest offered
by Wendell Phillips at the WASC. [So was AAP at the WASC or not?]

“No doubt you will have heard from more than one of your countrymen some
general account of the great Anti-Slavery Conference held in London in
June last, and of some of the vexed questions that were brought on for
discussion -- into these topics I will not enter at the present as my
simple object is to request you to do me a favor. At the closing sitting
of the Conference Wendell Phillips presented a protest which that Body
refused to place on its records but ordered, after it had been read, to
be laid on the Table. [It was meant to be kept by the BFASS, but Scoble
lent it to WP, who lent it to Adam, who lent it to WLG, who sent it to
the United States. Scoble asks Phelps to go to the Liberator office and
procure it from Oliver Johnson and send it back to the BFASS, as he is
anxious to have the original.] From the part I have felt it to be my
duty to take on the woman’s question &c I believe I am in very bad odour
with not a few of our friends who have come hither from the United
States – well I cannot help it – But of this you may be quite assured
that that question will make no way in this Country & that the
abolitionists of England will not fraternize with those who would link
it on to the question of emancipation. My best respects to the ladies of
your acquaintance who are [?] to the cause.”
