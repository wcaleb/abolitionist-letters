Sturge to AAP; Birmingham. Notice of the London Anti-Slavery meeting.
Abolition in England. Called the “General Anti-Slavery Convention which
is fixed to commence on the 13^th^ of June 1843.” Hopes that “we shall
have a large representation of our Transatlantic friends.”

“Our [events?] from France as thou wilt see from the Anti Slavery
Reporter of this week are very discouraging. The french King is
understood to be personally opposed to our cause indeed as he gets older
he appears to get more & more despotic and he is I believe disposed to
check the progress of liberty wherever he has the power. Guizot from
whom we looked for aid it is but too evident is only an abolitionist
just so far as he considers it politic to be one.”
