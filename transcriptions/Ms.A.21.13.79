“I was continually reminded of thee at the late Convention. It wd have
been cut up in fine style, by the keen edge of thy satire, hadst thou
been there.”

NPR to RDW; Boston. His vacation for his health with Francis Jackson.
Progress of Anti-Slavery cause. Sentiments of Ireland.

“I dont know what to write you about. Repeal, I care little for it, I
dread poor Ireland’s giving occasion to that [surly?] [minded?] John
Bull [burn?] his [?] into her unwary side. But I love the spectacle of a
nation on her feet without any thing in her hands – a teetotal nation!
Ireland can {u}stand{/u} now as she could not have done in the days of
whiskey. Tell O’Connell to enjoin on Ireland not only that she does not
strike the first blow, but that she does not the second. If England
strikes, let Ireland greatly forbear to return the blow. England would
lay down her arms them. Let O’Connell now speak the great word of
perpetual peace & forbearance. No man ever had such an opportunity. No
mortal man had such an audience, or would meet such a response, or
could, perhaps, speak it so well, if he only knew how. Let him make
Ireland almighty in position & character by just saying to her Peace &
good will to Englishmen, whether they strike or dont strike. That is
beneath Ireland (and beneath every body) to be guilty of striking. Let
her take this wonderful opportunity to step at once, & {u}as a
people{/u}, into the great position of divine good will, & set mankind
the example of a {u}nation{/u} of Reformers. Am I not right. The nation
is up, but not in arms. Her power is in her unarmed condition. Let her
throw her arms into the sea. Britain will throw hers in after for very
shame. She will not want Ireland as a subject province. It is
{u}armed{/u} Ireland, that she would hold down or {u}dis{/u}armed
Ireland. Not unarmed, not {u}arm{/u}less Ireland. She could not look
glorious Ireland in the eye, if it were flashing ‘the love light’ of
Peace upon her. The {u}Bull{/u}, as well as the Tiger & Lion, will cower
before the calm & kindly {u}human{/u} eye. Oh that O’Connell wou^d^ say
so to the assembled nation. I am talking large, dear Richard, when you
know all about it. ...”
