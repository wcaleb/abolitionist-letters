**[1844, 03-19] Ms.A.5.1.74**

LMC to Henrietta Sargent; New York. Encloses some lines; believes
violence will begin with annexation of Texas.

“Dear Henrietta, Here are the lines which I mentioned in my last letter,
but in my hurry forgot to enclose. They brought you and Catherine very
vividly before me, and are therefore very pleasant to me. //Things look
squally / now, in good earnest, / Do they not? If Texas / {u}is{/u}
annexed, the plot will thicken fast; and the accursed system of violence
and wrong will finally go down in an ocean of blood. Well, better so,
than to ride rough shod, as it now does, over all that is dear to man,
and holy in the sight of God.”
