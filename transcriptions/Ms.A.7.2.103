SJ May to Mary Estlin

Talks about what his children do and his activities trying to erect a
soldiers’ monument, service on the Board of Education in Syracuse,
efforts for freedmen, etc. “The newly freed men must be enfranchised,
and yet they are most of them undoubtedly very ignorant. For this you
well know they are not to blame. Still their ignorance unfits them for
the proper exercise of the franchise. Our American doctrine of universal
suffrage is undoubtedly correct. All men and, you know I say, all women
too, have an inalienable, because natural, right to take part in the
election of those, who are to enact, and of those, who are to
administer, the laws under which they are to live. But {u}no right is
unconditional{/u}. No one can have a right to do what he does not know
how, or does not intend {u}to do well{/u}. We have made a mistake in not
prescribing these as the obvious conditions of admission to the
suffrage. Knowledge of the Constitution of the Republic and of the State
in which one lives; and a fair moral character, that warrants the belief
that the individual will vote and act under these constitutions as he
verily believes to be best;--these should have been, from the beginning,
required as the qualifications of those who were to exercise the high
prerogative of citizens. But they have not been. And we have thousands
of citizens in all parts of our country, excepting perhaps Massachusetts
and the other N. E. States, who have never read, who cannot read, nor
have they ever heard read the Constitution of the United States, and yet
who vote, and often out vote intelligent and virtuous men. But it is too
late to correct this mistake. We cannot withdraw the prerogative from
those who possess it, thousands of whom in the rebellious states are as
ignorant as the lowest of those who until this war have been enslaved.
We must not leave the newly free men at the mercy of those who have
hitherto oppressed and despised them. We must give to the colored people
the ballot, or they will be driven to take to the bullet in self
defence; and we shall have another war more dreadful than this from
which we are now emerging, a war of races, a war not confined as this
has been, in its conflicts, to one portion of the country, but in every
state; every where, where there are colored people & their advocates,
and white people who are hostile to them. We must therefore put the
colored men in all the States, especially in the rebellious states, upon
the same level politically with the white men; and do the best we can to
educate them all. Education, universal education, intellectual and
especially {u}moral culture{/u} is now our only protection against the
mischief that may arise from universal suffrage. One thing we may be
assured of—those who have been slaves will not intentionally vote so as
in any way to favor the oppression of mankind; and on that point their
sufferings have made them very sensitive, and sagacious. We need not
fear that such enemies of humanity as John C. Calhoun, Jefferson Davis,
Robert E. Lee, John Mason Slidell and the other leaders of our
Rebellion, will ever be raised among the colored people of the Southern
States. But I pray all our English Friends to help us to the utmost to
educate the poor freedmen.” He regretted Garrison’s proposal to dissolve
the AASS, but he sees now that there are some good reasons. “The work,
which we have now to do, can perhaps be better done under other names
and by other and much larger constituencies. The Freedmen’s Protection,
Relief, and Education Societies, which are springing up in many parts of
the Northern States, will be, of course, anti-slavery, and they will
command the best services of many, who have not hitherto worked with
us.” Talks about founding of the *Nation*.
