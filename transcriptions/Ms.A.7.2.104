SJ May to Mary Estlin

All of his activities—as minister, Board of Education president,
Secretary of Freedman Relief Association in Syracuse, committee member
for poor hospital, and superintendent of missions to two Indian
tribes—make him too busy to write often. Recalls all the “pleasant
memories” from his time with her in England. Worries about President
Johnson. “I fear the freedmen are to be left to suffer much at the hands
of the ex-slaveholders.” Fears the coming of “another, not local, but
universal war.”
