SJ May to Mary Estlin

Glad that her brief trip to U.S. was pleasant. Is saddened that so many
British people “misunderstand the state of our national affairs. … I am
persuaded that Mr Phillips and his party have done much, perhaps more
than all else, to mislead, the judgments of our English friends.
Avowing, as they do, that their warfare is still with {u}Slavery{/u},
they lead to the inference, that nothing effectual was done by our
tremendous civil war. … Now, the change in our political and social
condition is immense, although I acknowledge very many things remain to
be done before the condition of our colored population will be what it
ought to be.”
