SJ May to Mary Estlin

He regrets the division in the ranks over the 15th amendment, focusing
on Anthony and Stanton’s group. “I confess too that I have always
thought that some qualification of intelligence should be required as a
condition of the right to vote, that the would be voter should show that
he had read and had a fair understanding of the Constitution. But I do
object to this qualification being required of colored, unless it can be
imposed likewise upon white men, which is said now to be impracticable.
What is to come of our free unqualified universal suffrage remains to be
seen. Nothing can save us from anarchy but Universal Education and I
rejoice to add that continually new provisions are being made for that.”
