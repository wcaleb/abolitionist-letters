Is grateful to their common friend, Mary Estlin, for making their
acquaintance. Explains Garrisonian position on the Constitution.
Criticizes Smith’s going to Congress and taking the oath to the
government. “O’Connell c[oul]d in all probability very conscientiously
have taken oath to half the constitution of England. He cd have
sustained the {u}state{/u} part of it, but not the {u}church{/u} part of
it. Would parliament, or could it have permitted the division of the
question wd it not have been fatal to the cause of Catholic Emancipation
had its champion proposed to try the experiment? … it is not on the
disunion question any more than on the free labour question that there
exists a division of heart among the Abolitionists. The Hon. J. W.
Giddings, Gerrit Smith, & others are willing to be blamed by us for what
we consider their shortcomings because they appreciated the devotedness
to the cause which makes us willing to do it. For F. Douglass … he will
always take the course that most promotes his own interest.”
