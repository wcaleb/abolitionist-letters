RDW to Mary Estlin; Dublin

“In my letters to America I have felt constantly impelled to plead
against the wholesale condemnation of all in this country as being
hostile to the good cause, simply because I knew such condemnation to be
unjust, and so do you. … Still I think it is the case that if the
contest had not been so prolonged & so terrible it would have been
difficult to bring the mass of the Northern people to consent to the
extinction of Slavery, just as it might be to induce Englishmen to
suppress the institution of hereditary aristocracy. Even as it is, it
will be a long time before the colored race get fair play, so powerful
is the [resistance?] and the prejudice which have been so rooted in the
popular mind.”
