Caroline Weston to Mary Estlin. Excerpt from a private letter printed in
the *Liberator* re: Lincoln’s assassination. “He will be missed in every
way, but no doubt or fear darkens the future of the Republic. Never
since we were a nation were we so strong as now, when all the strength,
ability, and virtue in the land pushes by a natural law in the right
direction.”
