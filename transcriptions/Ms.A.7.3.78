Mary Estlin to [Caroline?] Weston; Bristol. 8pp.

“… Aunt Emma I think published both to you & to our American
correspondents a scheme I had in contemplation for wintering in a
hydropathic establishment, formed chiefly in the hopes of luring my
Father off the scene of his wonted labors, & so letting them settle
themselves (kaleidoscope fashion) into some new form, instead of our
having to make a distinct repetition of the process of handing over or
rejecting every daily recurring professional, or philanthropic, or
social claim. But the dangerous illness of my cousin … has tied us to
home.”
