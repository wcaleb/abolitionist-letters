Steinthal to Mary Estlin

Talks about a meeting at which an Evangelical Alliance representative
gave a speech condemning the persecution of Protestants in Europe and
Germany in particular. Steinthal proposed an amendment to his
resolutions condemning the persecution of Southern Christians who try to
teach their slaves to read the Bible. “I replied that the Americans had
been held up as models to us that evening, so that the amendment was
quite in place, besides I for one could say that the Germans would have
good reason to object to our interference with them, unless they saw us
consistent.”
