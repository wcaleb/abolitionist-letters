**[1858, 03-11] Ms.A.9.2.1.11**

AWW to Alexandre de Humboldt. (Draft)

Forwards copy of *Liberty Bell* and another clipping. “I am encouraged
by a note addressed by your to the Journal des Debats in reference to
[illegible] work on Cuba in the July of 1856 to ask your acceptance of
the accompanying volume, ‘The Liberty Bell,’ a work annually published
by my sister M. W. C. to aid in the emancipation of the slaves of the
United States. The noble declarations contained in that note have
rendered your name dear to the hearts of the American abolitionists.
Surrounded as they are by every obstacle that the cupidity and
selfishness of a great nation can place in their way they read with the
most profound gratitude the sentiments that you have been so good as to
express. The present age is full of the glory of your scientific
reputation but in the coming future when human rights & human
brotherhood are better understood, it shall not be merely the savant,
but the philanthropist that the nations shall honour. Pray pardon the
great liberty that so unknown an individual as myself has taken in
addressing you …” (Photo of Humboldt’s article taken.)
