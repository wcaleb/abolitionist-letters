**[1840?] Ms.A.9.2.1.19**

MASS. Notes of a meeting at the Chardon St. Chapel. WP talks about his
English trip and CLR. JAC on the English abolition movement. Also notes
from a WP at Marl. Chapel, very similar to his 1849 one comparing the
odds stacked against West Indian emancipation with the French Revolution
(see Citation 1143). ...

[WP, Marl. Chapel speech:] “Read the beautiful history of the Anti
Slavery enterprise in Great Britain – behold the germ of its success in
the Burning energy of Clarkson in the piety the perseverance the
Eloquence of Wilberforce the immovable integrity of Granville Sharpe,
The devoted the disinterested self sacrifice of Macaulay The ... of
Buxton The stern unyielding strength of Principle with which the
youthful genius of Brougham starts into life, with a heart Burning with
its [?] resolves to defend to the death the cause the wronged – a
strength of [?] so irreconcilable with the weaker parts of his character
& cast, best & finest among the political members of that true band
glows O’Connell! The patriotic – the peerless in his giant influence. I
said he was the purest of the political members. When I met Fowell
Buxton in Italy, he recounted to me proofs of this incorruptibility.
“There were crises,” he said “when only Lushington & myself were ready
to go forward, and we could always rely on O’Connell. At one of these
crises, when it might have been supposed that as a political he [?]
sacrifice every other object & cause to his darling one the Welfare of
Ireland, on our asking what he meant to do, I shall do my duty, Was his
reply, & Ireland must take care of herself. ... It is said to be
improper for us to take up the consideration of the Subject of
Emancipation, because, unlike the English Abolitionist we have no legal
[?] for its accomplishment. Sir, we are all the more favourably situated
for that. It is the very reason that ensures the most favourable
termination of our struggle. [Because the Am Abos change for total moral
suasion.] ... England has been taunted [inconsistently?]. Let her look
to India, say the slaveholding advocates of Liberty. It is said that she
has done little or nothing because she has not done all. It is said she
has but done her duty by 800,000 out of the millions that suffer from
her misrule. Well, suppose she has done only that? Where is the nation
in the pale of Christendom that is not dumb before her? And America,
whose banner is a by-word in every foreign court, is she the party to
bid England to look to India. But England {u}has{/u} looked to India, &
to what purpose America will learn ere long. The sound of the cotton gin
is now heard on the banks of the Ganges, & the doom of slavery is to be
written down in the prices current of the cotton market of Liverpool.
... [Notes from {u}Meeting at the Chardon St. Chapel{/u}, to welcome the
return of WP, JAC, and Henry G. Chapman (Haiti) from abroad. Discusses
the divided state of British abolitionism. Recounts the BFASS’s
treatment of Collins. Look for this in Lib.]
