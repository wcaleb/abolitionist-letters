**[1859, 01-21] Ms.A.9.2.11.33**

William Powell to MWC; Liverpool (Date for the letter looks like it
could be 1839, but it refers to the arrival of Samuel J. May and Sarah
P. Remond, which seems to place it in 1859. See {u}BAA{/u} pp. 436-437)

African American in England; discusses Essex Co. business transaction;
contrasts liberty in England to U.S.

Powell is paying Chapman back for money that she sent to the Comptroller
of NY “for sundry tax bills” on Powell’s behalf. “I regret to say that
the Comptroller has omitted one lot of {u}40 acres{/u}, which I fear
will be lost, viz.: ‘No 1. South East quarter, in Essex County, Old
Military tract, Township 12. Richard survey containing 40 acres.’ I
shall feel extremely obliged by your giving him the above particulars
with a request to correct the mistake, and send you the bill for
payment.” Reports arrival of May and Remond. “I never knew I had a
country untill [sic] I crossed the Atlantic ocean. In old England
Liberty is not an empty name, as the American democratic cradle robbers
would have us believe. … I came to this strange country a poor despised
outcast, outlawed American negro, driven from my native country for no
‘color of crime’ but for the ‘crime of color.’ And here in monarchal
England I seek an asylum from the storms of American persecution & negro
hate. In this strange country I am regarded as a {u}man{/u}, and
invested with all the rights of a British born subject, without even the
farce of {u}naturalization{/u}. Taxation & representation are together
alike awarded to every subject who conforms to the provisions of the
Reform law of 1832. … Here I exercise my right as a voter, sit on
juries, and am eligible to hold office under the government, municipal
or otherwise. Can I say as much in favor of Republican Slaveholding
America, the land of my birth?” His motto is now “Ubi Libertas Ibi
Patria.”
