Mott, Lucretia to MWC; Dublin. The writer refers to her experience at
the WASC. {Most printed in {u}BAA{/u}. Good quotes.}

“We discovered before we left Philad{u}^a^{/u} that the name of the
Convention was changed & saw the letter of Jos{u}^h^{/u} Sturge – [?]
rec{u}^d^{/u} our credentials conditionally -- & after being refused by
the com. we felt satisfied not to present them to the Meeting. [p] I was
glad however that Wendell Phillips & Ann were not so easily put by &
that he came forward & manfully plead for the right. I shall ever love
Ann Phillips for her earnest appeals to her husband to stand firm in
that hour of trial – and him for doing so – Tell Abby Kelley if I am not
much bold myself I respect those most who are so. – Tho’ I fully believe
if our English & Irish friends thought there were any in America whose
foreheads were more as adamant than mine, they would be awe-struck –
yea, horrified! – I never failed in our several tea-parties, soirees, &c
to avail myself of every offer made for utterance for our cause & then I
shrunk not from the whole truth as those who heard can testify. Egotism
must be excused for woman’s sake.”
