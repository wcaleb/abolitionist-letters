**[1841, 02-25] Ms.A.9.2.13.26-28**

EQ to MWC and HGC. Refers to the {u}Hour and the Man{/u} (Martineau) and
asks H.G. Chapman to find out all he can about Toussaint L’Ouverture.
The writer holds a high opinion of Toussaint and wants to know about
emancipation in Haiti. Says his father had a white horse which was sent
to Haiti and sold to the Emperor Christophe. Talks about JAC’s trip.
Discusses Adin Ballou’s proposed community.

“One of the most interesting events that has since transpired [since the
annual meeting] was the arrival of your letter of Jan. 22d. giving an
account of the style of living of the property & standing of Cap. I have
made use of it to exalt the opinions of some of my acquaintances as to
the possibility of the progress of the negro race – for it is level to
the [meanest?] capacity to perceive that that a negro eating turtle soup
with a gold spoon or picking up a {u}ragout{/u} with a silver fork is a
very different moral phenomenon from one devouring his peck of corn a
week with the spoons & forks (the pickers & stealers) he inherited from
father Adam. Since your exile was decreed we cannot too much rejoice
that you were directed to the most interesting spot of all the earth at
the present point of the grand revolution in the midst of which we live.
And then to think of your reading the Hour & the Man on the very scene
where its story is told. Pray find out every thing you can about
Toussaint & all his [?] – but of course you will. I apprehend Miss M.
has not at all exaggerated his character – at least it is not beyond
what I had conceived of it from what I knew before. I have always placed
him at the head of the fighting & governing men of the modern world –
not excepting Washington, whom he surpassed in military & civil genius &
at least equalled [sic] in magnanimity & disinterestedness, & he was no
slaveholder when he was fighting for liberty, but a consistent champion
of freedom. The most interesting part to me was the account in the
appendix of her visit to his prison & grave at [Joux?]. If I were a
sentimental traveller [sic] I would far sooner make a pilgrimage to the
tomb of Toussaint than to Mount Vernon, & as far as that vulgar ruffian
whose carcass they have fetched from St. Helena & stuck down in the
[{u}Invalides{/u}?] – bah! I spit at it! [p] But your book (I breathe
not its name) will be far more interesting as it will be authentic.
Indeed I think your education for the last seven or eight years in the
A.S. cause has been a fitting one for your task – for the careful habit
of verifying facts & the practice of excessive accuracy in their
statement – in short the revolutionaries & Right & Wrong [?] of your
life – will now make your task of getting at the truth & expressing it
easy & profitable. Get as much of the History of the Revolution as you
can into it. A sketch of the [abolition? violence?] as brief space as is
compatible with accuracy seems to me absolutely necessary – so great is
the ignorance which prevails on the subject. The books that I have read
on Haiti take the readers knowledge of these things for granted which is
a very great piece of presumption on their part. Make the book as living
as you can – by getting facts & {u}traits{/u} as much as possible from
the living actors whom you may meet. But whatever you tell will be new
in a great measure to the reading public of England & America.
Especially try to divest it of the appearance of a partisan publication
– it will of course be so represented, but be careful that it be without
reason. I want to know more about Dessalines & Christophe & their
excellent [{u}travestie{/u}?] of the old regal & aristocratic
absurdities. I, too, have some connection with [S.M.?] Henrie I. – thus.
At the time of the late war my father was captain of a troop of cavalry
called the [?Hassans?], which I dare say you, Chapman, remember in your
[?] days, as it was probably the most splendidly accoutred & appointed
cavalry company we have ever had in this country. Well – we had a superb
charger, the [glory?] of the country – of a perfect white without a
black hair, and his name was Bayard. When the war was over, & there was
no prospect of actual service (as he used to tell my brother when
rejoicing in the peaceful glorious of [Government?] aid) he resigned his
commission & the company was soon disbanded as too expensive. Bayard was
sold & some time after my father came home one day & asked my mother
what she guessed had become of him. “O,” said she “I don’t know. I
suppose the king of Haiti has got him” – speaking at random of course.
But so it was. Bayard was sent to Haiti on speculation & forthwith
bought by Christophe & the story went that he was his sable majesty’s
favorite charger. Such is my relationship to the royal family of Haiti.”
