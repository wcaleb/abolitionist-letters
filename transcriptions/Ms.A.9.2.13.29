NPR to HGC and MWC; Concord. A friendly letter of remembrance and good
wishes. The writer recalls that the finest looking man he saw in London
was a Haitian.

“Will you read a word of remembrance from me, in your Haitian exile. I
have remembered you brightly ever since I heard of your intended voyage.
Am thankful to hear of dear friend H.G’s convalescence, thanks be to God
& His Soft air of the tropics. Breathe it your fill & inhale health. Oh
how that atmosphere has inspired the despairing breath in the days of
Slavery – Has the taint left it! What an emancipation [regal?] forcible
one is compared to our deep movement. [p] I Shou^d^ love to see the
Sable [Count?]. The finest looking man I saw in London was a Haitian. It
will quite relieve you of your remains of color-phob., the society of
St. Domingo.”
