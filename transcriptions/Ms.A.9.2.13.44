Sargent, Henrietta, to David Lee Child. The writer wishes the addressee
to state William Adam’s qualifications as the delegate of the MASS to
the World’s Convention. The writer holds him qualified because he lived
twenty-one years in Bengal. Quotes at length Mr. Adam’s statement about
his attitude toward Anti-Slavery efforts in the United States.

“I wish you to state to the [MASS] Board that Mr. Adam has resided
twenty one years in Bengal as a Missionary – an Editor – and the
Company’s Servant to visit all the provinces and report on the schools;
which last duty occupied him for five years – and introduced him to the
character the wants, the cruel oppression of the natives. As a
{u}philanthropist{/u}, a scholar and a Christian, no one is better
qualified (either in Britain or America) to stand shoulder to shoulder
with George Thompson, and before the world, plead the cause of the poor
slave in British India. The Abolitionists of this country owe a debt to
the friends of humanity in Gr Britain, for sending to us George
Thompson, that they can in no way so well discharge, as by aiding Mr.
Adam to attend this convention, prompted as he is by no selfish view,
but by the desire of informing the British people that when they boast
that every British subject is a free man, their congratulations are
premature, that their work is only half done, and that the East India
Company’s government has perpetuated and some times aggravated slavery.
[p] Mr. Adam’s reasons for not having labored with the friends of the
slave in this country are contained in a work of his, now in the press,
the following extract, (if you bear in mind that he is yet a stranger
here), must prove sufficient to justify him in this forbearance thus
far.

“On the question of Slavery here (US -) I have not the information that
would “ enable me with intelligence and undoubting conviction to
advocate the views of any “ of the parties that represent the
subdivisions of public opinion; but because I feel

“ that I am powerless at present to promote the good of the slave in
this country, I

“ should be exceeding sorry to have it supposed that I am indifferent to
his welfare,

“ a neutral or uninterested spectator of the exertions made for his
benefit, and

“ without sympathy with those who devote their days and their nights,
their time and “ strength, the best energies of their bodies and minds
to his cause. Although not a “ citizen of the U States, yet as a citizen
of the world – a far higher and nobler title – “ I look upon every
slave, in every country, as an injured and oppressed fellow man; “ and
from the bottom of my soul I wish God speed to every attempt based on

“ Christian principles, and executed in the spirit of Christian charity,
to strike off the

“ fetters of the slave and to let the oppressed go free. ...
