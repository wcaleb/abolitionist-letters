Knight, Anne to MWC. Condemns exclusion of women at WASC.

“Tacitus relates the Germans always called the women to their
war-counsels because {u}they{/u} had something divine in them & do not
your Indians have their conferences unitedly the scientific conferences
of France are men & women membered myself being a member & having
addressed them as [Leige?] & as Blois on the subject of slavery our own
society unites its men & women in mission conference & if we may handle
the holy things is it for our own sect to raise its voice opposing our
{u}secular or moral{/u} engagement? forbid it common sense & thou my
dear Maria Chapman cease not to cry aloud, to lift up thy voice like a
trumpet for surely if Indian women if German women if the woman of
France may colloquize with men the women of England not less Christian
so not less {u}qualified{/u} than they must erelong, what is dark
illumine. Pray sent the emphatic question across the Atlantic from they
strong pen to our {u}exclusives{/u} at Broad Street – a most
inappropriate name it ought to be the street which is called straight
send it to be read in their council ... I wish it were practicable for
thee to come to England very soon & continuing the subject now begun
spread the cause of humanity more fully through our land by the time of
a second convention it would be more deserving the name of World’s
Convention.”
