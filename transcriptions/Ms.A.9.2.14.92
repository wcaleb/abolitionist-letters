**[1840] Ms.A.9.2.14.92.**

Burleigh, C.C., to MWC. Re: the “English mission” of John A. Collins.
Perhaps should be dated 1841? N.D. on the letter. Express Burleigh’s
reservations about Collins’s trip, and hopes it can be called off if

by the Ex. Comm. in haste, without consulting friends in various parts
of the country. And ...

“In aiming to secure the confidence of British Abolitionists, we ought
not to risk too much the weakening of that of our friends at home. As to
this movement, I do not think [of] an abolitionist here who would
cordially approve it, while most if not all would {u}dis{/u}approve
decidedly.”
