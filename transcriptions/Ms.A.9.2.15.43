Hilton, John Telemachus, to Chapmans; Boston. Rejoices in the safe
arrival and warm reception of the addressees in Hayti. {To the care of
Capt John Freeman, Cape Haytien.}

â€œEsteemed friends: Your safe arrival on the Haytian soil, the warm
reception and kind attention, you have recd at the hands of the friends
in this Country, as Communicated to us in your heart cheering epistles,
have been highly gratifying to your numerous friends this side of the
[bid?] waters. Indeed it is not easy for my pen to portray the deep
interest felt and expressed in your behalf. The news of the improvement
of Mr Chapmans health has been recd with much joy and gratitude to God.
The loss of your labour in the great field of Liberty and humanity for a
spell is sensibly felt and acknowledged. We truly miss the devoted
friends of the Slave, but we do not mourn as those that have no hope.
For we know that if God prosper you, you will be with us again. Besides
we believe that your visit to Hayti will be a precious benefit to the
Anti-Slavery Cause.
