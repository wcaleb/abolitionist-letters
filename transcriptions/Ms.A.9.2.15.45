Tredwell., to MWC and HGC. Port Plate, Santo Domingo. The writer
indulges himself with the idea that, through the addressees agency,
“Hayti will soon become a powerful coadjutor with the Antislavery
Society in the U.S.A.” Suggests the printing of a pamphlet in the French
language, addressed to Haitiens, setting forth “the effect which slavery
still has upon Haiti,” and inviting the government to participate in the
(anti-slavery) labors.

“In taking my leave of you permit me to express my unfeigned with that
not only the particular object of your visit to Haiti may be realised,
but that the [cause?] of the oppressed in which you are engaged may also
be advanced. I shall indulge myself with the idea that Haiti will soon
become a powerful coadjutor with the Antislavery Society of the U.S. and
that through your agency if God willing. If it should be that your
society think proper or advisable to open a corispondence [sic] with
this Government; permit me to suggist [sic] to you the idea of getting
up something like a brief account of the rise and progress and future
prospects of the cause, then shew [show?] the great advantage which a
conquest gained by peaceful means will have over that which is won by
war & bloodshed, and finally show distinctly the effect which Slavery
still has upon Haiti in all its connexions. I would then invite the
Government to a participation in the labours by its recommending the
establishment of auxiliries [sic] throughout this country. I would
recommend that the document be printed in a pamphlet form in the french
language and addressed to the Haitiens, together with the Constitutions
of the ‘Philanthropic Society of Port Plate. Sincerely wishing you a
pleasant passage, a happy meeting with your family & friends abundant
success in the cause of the oppressed as well as in your personal
affairs, and finally a happy entrance into the rest prepared for the
just by our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ.” [Signed “in the bonds of
Christian love.”]
