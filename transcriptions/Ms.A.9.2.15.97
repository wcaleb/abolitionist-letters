Hildreth, Richard, to Caroline Weston. Demerara, British Guiana. Before
leaving Boston, the writer deposited with JAC the stereotype plates of
his books, {u}Archie Moore{/u} and {u}Despotism in America{/u}, to be
printed and sold by the MASS. ... Discusses his theory of progress and
reaction. Has sent the addressee a report on the laboring population of
this colony, containing “decisive proofs that the black population,
within a very moderate period, will become the lords of the soil here.”
Explains the difference of status between the blacks and the mulattos,
and the practice of intermarriage between the mulattos and the whites.
{According to card catalogue, Hildreth was in Guiana from 1840-1843.}

“I never have heard any [story?] of the adventures of Mrs Chapman in the
island of Hayti, though I fully expected that a book would be
forthcoming on that subject. ...

“ ... lords of the soil here. When that event occurs the true prosperity
of the colony will begin. I say the {u}black{/u} people in
contradistinction to the whites & the {u}colored{/u}, for you must be
aware that the {u}colored{/u} people that is the mulattos form in the
West Indies a class as distinct as the whites, & one which partakes
fully of all kinds of white prejudices. The colored people have had the
double disadvantage of a creole education, and of an equivocal position.
They are a sort of appendage to the whites. The blacks will supercede
them both. In the United States when the colored & the black are
[forced?] together, the difference between them does not strike you
much. Here, on the contrary, it is quite as noticeable as that between
the blacks & the whites, while the difference between the colored & the
white appears trivial in comparison.”
