British attitudes on War, etc. Says it’s not surprising that most
British people don’t understand the war or American politics. Reiterates
that American visitors have been the most important teachers of British
public opinion, and most of these have been proslavery. Also there is
some vindictive pleasure in seeing former colonies torn apart. “I never
doubted from the time of the attack on Fort Sumter that the death blow
of slavery in the United States was struck at the same time, & that the
consummation was merely a question of time.” Talks about his surprise
that such acrimony between England and America has arisen. “I fancy if
the American & the English spoke different language they would get on
more peaceably. Here in Ireland 1 ½ millions of Protestants live among 4
½ millions of Catholics, who stick to the Pope with the intensest
ultramontane fervour, who are the slaves of the priests, who abhor
Garibaldi & the unity of Italy, and would gladly see the Austrian’s heel
on the neck of her people. Under such circumstances thoughtful people
are obliged to admit that their neighbours may be ignorant & deluded, &
yet very good people in the main. So I maintain that there is a great
deal in the past & present condition of the United States & the
declarations & professions of Northern clergy, statesmen, editors, &
authors, to justify the difficulty Englishmen have in making up their
minds.” Defends Harriet Martineau by saying that despite her faults no
one in Europe has done more to promote antislavery views. He is pained
to see Martineau out of abolitionists’ favor while John Bright, who was
never an abolitionist until the war broke out, is “elevated into a hero.
… Many years ago he & the Anti Corn Law League placed busts of Calhoun &
Mac Duffie in their board room, as good staunch Free Traders.
