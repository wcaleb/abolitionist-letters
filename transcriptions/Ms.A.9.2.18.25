Fisher, Rebecca, to MWC; Lifford, near Limerick, Ireland. The writer
thanks the addressee for her kind remembrance and expresses admiration
for the latter’s devotion to the Anti-Slavery cause. ... Is reading
Emerson’s {u}Essays{/u}.

“Oh I sometimes wish you could see us in our far off homes & know how
earnestly & fervently & thrillingly we receive and drink in your weekly
pourings forth of instruction & love in your Anti Slavery papers the
Liberator & Standard & Herald of Freedom. We bear you continually upon
our hearts—alone in the still chamber—alone in the impressive
solitariness of nature, in the fields and among the trees & flowers &
birds or when we go forth with loving hearts feeling our fellow beings
as dear brothers & sisters. [p] Accept our affectionate thanks dear Mrs.
Chapman for your beautiful gifts … dear Mrs. Child has explained to us
the true value & use of love gifts—they make us ‘try harder to be good.’
… How true as you have said that every truth that the human soul
receives is a part of every other truth, and that it is not possible for
us, though we would, to sunder what God has joined—since I have opened
my mind to receive Anti-Slavery principles. I have felt truth after
truth (at least what I believe to be such) pouring in, breaking the
bonds & surmounting the obstacles of previous opinion or feeling. I feel
that I can no more stem the tide than stay the waves of the mighty
ocean. I feel that the heart should expand and expand and expand until
it clasps the whole universe.” Enjoyed Wright’s visit.

Enclosed note from her sister Rebecca praises Channing’s sermon which
argues that “the end & essence of life” is “to expand all our faculties
& affections.” But it were endless for me to talk of all we owe to
America. We are just now reading Emerson’s Essays, that most spiritual
of books. It is the most dazzling, the most soul-entrancing book, I ever
read, so full as it is of living truth.”
