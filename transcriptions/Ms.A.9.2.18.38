“[Has delayed writing in the hopes of assembling the Society so as to
forward its deliberations but] in this I have been disappointed from the
Present Excited State of the Country occasioned by the expected Glorious
change in the Government of this Island, the Particulars of which no
doubt You are well Acquainted with by this time, it would be therefore
Superfluity to say much about it in this letter. In the mean time Permit
me to say that we are truly Glad to hear from You & that Notice had been
taken of our humble efforts to extend the Cause of Freedom, though I
regret much that up to this the Liberator & Standard referred to in
yours have not come to hand. ... Yet Messrs Cross [Dubuz? Dubing?] &
others was somewhat gratified with the short paragraph in the Paper
sent. ... [Condolences.] ... Madam [Paquion?] are Residing in this
Place, I have communicate to her the substance of your Letter [sic], &
in Reply I herewith forward one from her. ... The [Salia?] Family only
lost 1 Daughter, But Suffered in Property as all others. Senor Morillas
{u}Lost{/u} most every thing But his Life. ... I am Sorry that I am not
able to have some thing to communicate Respecting the cause that is so
Dear to our Souls. This is owing to the {u}Tyrant Boyer{/u}, whose
Abdication & the [Particulars?] Resulting in a new form of Government in
this Island no Doubt You are already acquainted with. Yes I am ashame

of the friends of the Cause which at that time was very Large & might
Say all Pto. Pla. many in St. Yago & country I was {u}Requested{/u} By
the Commandent [sic] La Place that that we should postpone the meeting &
meet in the daytime. Those of our friends who knew more at this
Government than I did told me that it was a compleat [sic] prohibition
to our Society. We then forwarded Petitions to President Boyer for the
priviledge [sic] to meet at night, but in every case he has denyed [sic]
