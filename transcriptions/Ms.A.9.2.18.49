AWW to Caroline and Deborah Weston? Boston. ... Attended the Anniversary
Peace meeting, addressed by Andrew P. Peabody. ... The writer heard
Lewis Tappan nominate Mr. Pennington, a colored man, as a delegate to
London. Amos A. Phelps and Nathaniel Colver are appointing agents to the
Peace Convention.

“I went to the Anniversary Peace meeting at Rogers’ Church. It went off
very well. ... After the public meeting was over {u}I{/u} would stay,
despite the behavior of Lucia & Emma who tried to get me away to hear
their private doings. There was some mischief, particularly when Lewis
Tappan made his appearance. Among other things, he nominated Mr.
Pennington as a delegate to the London Peace Society. He is you know a
coloured man – but they voted it. Berkwith is going to London, & Phelps
& Colver are appointing agents to the Peace Convention.”

John Bright to Joseph Sturge. Defends his opposition to the exclusion of
slave-grown produce, and argues that Struge’s view in favor of keeping
duties high only injures the poor and is a minority opinion. The public
believes that the discussion at the 1843 World’s Convention where Cobden
spoke was prejudiced towards Sturge’s view, even though most of the
people there probably agreed with Cobden and Bright. “The true policy
would be not to interfere in the matter electorally or as a Committee,
but when slave produce came in to consume only free grown & leave others
at liberty to do as they thought best. … In a country whose trade is so
extensive as ours the idea of enquiring into the moral condition of
every people with whom we trade seems to me most irrational. Hitherto no
result but injury to our own people has followed your policy—you are in
effect leagued with those who abet the worst crime every perpetrated
against a people—the supporters of monopoly & you range yourselves
against the truth of free trade by assuming that to be truth which is
admitted on all hands to be utterly & palpably impossible.”

Davis, Thomas, to RDW; Providence. His business dealings; May meeting in
Boston; Hibernian Society’s stand on sending delegates to London;
account of New England Convention; repeal movement.

[Criticizes Collins’ recent reform efforts as ignoring the spiritual
aspect of men and making them slaves of their social circumstances.] ...
I was very much pleased with the document sent forth by the Hibernian
Society, declining to send delegates to London, it was dignified just &
kind, we have been two [sic] much in the habit of saying hard things, or
rather [hurting?] in hard words & supposing they render truth more
powerful, not so they rather weaken it by mixing it up with the language
of passion. I was amused the other day at reading a comment on Garrison
& his coadjutors copied from a Boston Irish newspaper into the
Liberator, under the head of refuge of oppression the writer poured out
his vials of wrath on Garrisons head, & pronounced a glowing eulogy on
Oconnell & the cool comment of the editor was ‘there you feel better
now.’ ... What is to be the results of the repeal movement, I would give
more for your private opinion than for the comments of the press, it
strikes me that however desirable it cannot be carried without a
terrible physical conflict, this I do not want to see, do you think
Oconnell is failing in his powers. I think you or some one else
expressed such an opinion to me when there, the Irish are waking up in
all parts of this Country, & they find some sympathy from a portion of
the American people, a meeting is called in New York to be held in the
Park the most public place in the City, at which Ex Gov Seward is to
preside, to consider the repeal question, I see one is called in this
place, & I hardly know whether to attend it or no, I am in favour of
repeal, if it can be brought about without bloodshed, but I doubt if it
can, it appears from our papers that the English have taken possession
of the Sandwich Islands, a portion of the religious papers are very
indignant at that proceeding, which will serve to kindle the flame
against England, the Southern States have their peculiar cause of
complaint at the measures taken for the abolition of Slavery in Texas,
this would be a severe blow to the hopes of the South, I pray they may
be successful in the last mentioned enterprise though, I think it will
be an era in the progress of the world when the power of the British
government is broken. [Mentions his idolizing of Emerson.]
