DLC to MWC; New York. Discusses affairs of the Standard. The writer is
pleased that the addressee understood “‘egotism’, the most dangerous
{u}ism{/u} perhaps that we have to deal with. Our anti-slavery world is
not {u}the{/u} world; but renown therein is sometimes mistaken for world
renown.” Continues in this vein. Comments on the Liberator and will use
extracts of the two leading articles for the Standard. “I do not think
it worth while to discuss minute differences when the summa rerum is at
stake.”

“ ... world renown. We feel puffed up with our little retinue, and like
the tipsy one mount a wall and halloo, ‘Attention the Universe! By
Kingdoms, to the right wheel, march!’ I have no objections. The world
ought to wheel {u}to the right{/u}, but then I dont want to enlist under
every one who undertakes to mount and give the word of command, not to
be kicked right if I do not see the way to step it.”
