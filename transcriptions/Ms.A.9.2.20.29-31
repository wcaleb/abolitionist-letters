Abdy, Edward Strutt, to MWC; University Club, Pall Mall, East London.
... Talks about his book; also the annexation of Texas. {Bulk in
{u}BAA{/u}; Abdy is clearly identified in the manuscript as the writer.}

“My work on America was sent to Garrison, with the copyright; but, as I
never heard from him, I concluded that neither had reached him. Another
copy was sent to Mrs. Child, &, if I mistake not, her husband told me he
had read it. I met him at Paris and gave him a copy of an answer I had
published in a Paris paper to a defence of his countrymen from the
charge of slaveholding by Mr. Baird or Mr. Beard. ... With respect to
the republication of my ‘Journal,’ Harper advertised, but withdrew, his
resolution of paying it that honor, fearful of offending the Southerners
who had written to him on the subject. ... Dr. Julius informed me some
years ago that he had seen a copy of my work at the Boston Athenaeum.
The Dr., you are probably aware, was commissioned about ten years back
to inspect your prisons. On his return to Germany, he published a very
elaborate work on the moral & social condition of the U.S. As the author
is very severe in his remarks on the treatment the Blacks receive from
the majority of your fellow citizens, I take it for granted that no
translation has ever made its appearance among them. It is written with
great [?] & impartiality, & tho’ the style is [heavy?] & the matter
somewhat too diffuse, its contents will be found extremely valuable to
the historian & the philosopher. Von Raumer is, I believe, taking notes
among you at this moment. It would be as well if some of your friends
would guard him against the misrepresentations which will certainly be
practiced by those who dread exposure. I was anxious that this should be
done in the case of Dickens & suggested in vain several times that a
note to that effect should be inserted in the Anti-Slavery Reporter. At
last a few lines with my initials were honored with admission. I might
have spared myself so much trouble, for Mr. Scoble, I found by mere
accident, had taken the hint & written privately to Joshua Leavitt. You
should know that we have a sort of censorship here & whatever displeases
its directors is mutilated or suppressed. ... A few communications to
the Reporter some time ago from Germany were duly ‘licensed’ – an
exception however was made in the case of an extract I had translated
from a letter by a German to the Algmeine Teitung in reference to a
meeting he had been present at of the Malta Anti-Slavery Society. He had
been not a little astonished on hearing one of its members declare that
emancipation was obligatory upon Xtians but not upon Mahometans, as
{u}their{/u} prophet had permitted & their religion enjoined slavery.
The writer had in vain protested against this distinction. I thought it
right that publicity should be given to a circumstance so highly
discreditable to the narrator or to the Society, that an opportunity
should be afforded of refuting or of proving, the accusation: & that
misplaced confidence should be withdrawn either by the journal in
question from its correspondent, or by our Society from its sister
institution. I will just add that the note to Arthur Tappan appended to
the pamphlet I send you was declined with this considerate notice (I
quote from memory), ‘Mr. Abdy’s letter &c. ... does not {u}suit our
columns{/u}’ & that a promise given to expose the French African
Institute, which, according to Mr. Scoble, has drawn 300 [pounds symbol]
from the pockets of English dupes, has, if I do not greatly err, never
been [redeemed?]. [Refers at length to the recent Convention, and the
refusal of the Quakers and Moravians to accept into fellowship black
men.] ... Whatever the motive, however, or the result of the exclusion:
-- whether the taboo of the high priest inflicted or reflected more
dishonor, I may be pardoned for wishing that the Convention of Colored
Americans would depute to the next ‘cosmopolitan Congress’ some worthy
representative of their [firmness?], one who will be true to his
mission, uninfluenced alike by fear and by favor, resolved that the
grievances of his race shall be proclaimed to the world. ... Here we
have schisms among reformers & selfishness among philanthropists. Human
associations, like religious establishments, degenerate into instruments
of private vanity or interest, & those who undertake to cure our
infirmities take good care to remind us of their own. ... There seemed
at last year’s Convention to be a rivalry of adulation among the
political parties of the day. Ld. Palmerston’s influence with the Bey of
Tunis was set off against Aberdeen’s with the President of Texas; & the
Whig humanity in the old world was pitted against the Tory humanity in
the new. No one had any more doubt of the sincerity attached to these
cabinet professions than he had of the African chief’s independence of
the Sultan & the French court or of Houston’s liberty of action between
a free state on one side and Slave states on the other. No one asked
whether prospective freedom was right in Africa & wrong in America –
whether immediate emancipation could be consistently demanded in one
part of the world & gradual emancipation be received with thanks in
another. Not a voice was raised in behalf of an unoffending ally
despoiled of her most valuable province – nor did one of the opponents
to a separate legislature in oppressed Ireland [“offer a” is crossed
out; the replacement is “hint?”] an objection to the usurpation of every
political function by the voluntary subjects of a transatlantic empire.
Yet it required no great sagacity to see that the recognition of this
new state had done more to injure the cause for which the Convention had
assembled than the English government had ever done in its favor. Texas
must, by the process of assimilation, be incorporated with one of its
neighbors. The attraction of free blacks & the attraction of slaves
cannot neutralize each other. It must conquer or be conquered. If but a
slight acquaintance with the peculiarities of your system had existed
where it was both needed & expected, would our government have been
[prompted?] to acknowledge a state of things which had been brought
about for the express purpose of supporting what they professed to
abominate? Was it not evident to every inquirer that your planters
sought in Texas a [security?] for their private property & an increase
to their federal prerogatives; -- that the revolted province could
neither keep a promise of emancipation without offending the people it
had left nor break it without attacked the people it had betrayed: &
that the maintenance of its separate establishment was equally
incompatible with its strength & its weakness? [See {u}BAA{/u}.] ...
reason to envy expediency. ... We cannot, I am ashamed to say, claim
exemption from the prejudice of color. Wilberforce, I was told by Miss
Macaulay, was heard to declare that he should not feel at his ease if at
table with a negro: -- and de Beaumont, when asked why Bissette was not
a member of the Committee of the French Abolition Society replied –
‘Why! he is a colored man.’ Here we have a religious man & a liberal
expressing sentiments opposed to every rational idea of what we owe to
God & to humanity. Thus it is that Benevolence is employed to foster
Pride – we humiliate while we relieve -- & we claim superiority of
nature from mere superiority of fortune. It really seems as if many
considered an African & a bullock as entitled to the same sort of
sympathy, & subscribed to the Anti-Slavery society as they subscribe to
the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. I infer, from the
remarks of L’Instant (the Haytian) on this subject, that these
strictures may be applied to some who have taken an active part in the
cause of abolition among us; & perhaps the skin-proud ‘Friends’ in the
‘city of love’ may look for a defence of their ‘short-comings’ as much
to the consciousness of the same weakness as to religious affinities in
the City of Commerce and hope that London will not blush for
Philadelphia. ... The less that is said of our Emancipation Act the
better for those who carried it. It has established a principle by which
the innocent & the oppressed may be made to pay for the cessation of
outrages they could not have prevented, & for the recovery of rights
they had never forfeited. It has put conventional morality above natural
justice & encouraged iniquity by removing the fear of its consequences.
Actions are thus to be remunerated in proportion to their wickedness.
Indictments are to be loaded with charges to secure conviction, & the
judges are to award damages in favor of the guilty. It was a measure
concocted by Fraud & conceded by Folly. It presumed a loss that could
not be proved & aggravated wrongs it affected to redress. Its
‘compensation’ was a premium upon oppression, & its ‘apprenticeship’ was
the punishment of misfortune. Such was the boon to suffering humanity
for which the Whigs are lauded by their tools & their [toad-eaters?] --
and these are the patrons & protectors of liberty – men who pocketed in
the colonies what they had voted in Parliament – who ordered every
colored stranger to be excluded from the land they had freed from the
distinction of color, & who are now taxing the blacks that they may
reduce the wages of freedom by immigration from Africa & with paupers
where they can no longer traffic with slaves. This base compromise has
found its proper place in the Statesman’s Book of Precedent. It might
have been gratefully proposed as an example the other day in Macaulay’s
didactic letter to his free-trade constituents. We should thus then have
been exultingly reminded of our imbecility -- & ‘the shame’ of the
philanthropist would have been added to ‘the glory’ of the politician.
The mean subserviency you have so forcibly & so justly condemned in
English travellers is not likely to be repeated. Truth will in future be
promoted by its former impediments. ... [Most of rest in {u}BAA{/u}.]”
