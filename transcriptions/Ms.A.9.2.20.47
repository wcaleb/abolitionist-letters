Haughton, James, to MWC; Dublin. ... Discusses the question of British
trade with Brazil ... The writer has appealed to the London Committee
“to cry out against all slave produce.” Contrasts MWC’s non-resistance
with his own attitude toward government action. James H. Webb, brother
of RDW, professes to be “more of an absolute Non-resistant than any of
us.” The Irish people are now almost wholly absorbed in their political
troubles. As D.O’C. has a horror of bloodshed “while he lives, I believe
we shall be safe from the calamity of civil war.” Irish agitation is a
security for the peace of Europe, as England, if invaded, would get no
help from Ireland. {Bulk in {u}BAA{/u}.}

“... I rejoice at every indication of success in your Anti-Slavery
labors, your noble declaration ‘No Union with Slaveholders’ meets my
warm approval. I would avoid all possible contact with such men. We mean
again to stimulate our acquaintances on behalf of your next Bazaar, but
it is difficult to excite any deep anti slavery feeling here. It is
looked upon rather [as] a work in which we have little or no concern;
that we have abolished the evil in our own dominions, & that that is
sufficient on our part. Our political position ... [see {u}BAA{/u}: His
theory of government would be “a concentration of the voice of the whole
people.” All men and women would have a voice in the election. He
disagrees with MWC on the sugar duties question.]”
