EPN to MWC; Scotland. The writer regrets that she has been unable to do
more for the Anti-Slavery cause “... the cause of humanity is {u}one{/u}
the world over ...” O’Connell mentioned. etc.

“I can only say, in reference to they expressions of {u}gratitude{/u}
for the little I have ever done or am doing for your great & noble
cause, that they make me blush & deeply feel how {u}very{/u} little I
have in my power to aid it – but, dear friend, had my efforts in its
behalf been a thousand times greater than they have been, {u}thanks{/u}
wd be out of place – for the cause of humanity is {u}one{/u} the world
over – They who have drunk but a little into the spirit of human
brotherhood, must feel that the friends of human redemption wherever
scattered are linked in a common cause -- & waging a warfare against a
common enemy. Every inroad that is made on the reign of oppression,
every step gained in favour of liberty, every blow that is struck at the
kingdom of violence & blood, in whatever quarter of the Globe, is so
much gained in behalf of universal freedom. And it is pleasant to feel
it so, for it seems to unite in bonds which not even the wide rolling
Atlantic can sever, those, who are striving however feebly, to
disenthral [sic] the minds & the bodies of their fellow men from the
bondage of spiritual & personal slavery in which they have so long been
held – for neither species is confined to your side the Atlantic – the
fetters in which {u}mind{/u} is bound, are more galling on our side than
your’s [sic] -- & so long as a grasping aristocracy & the sordid
worshippers of {u}mammon{/u} have the power to retain so large a
proportion of our population in abject poverty, we cannot be said to be
an absolutely free people – tho’ the persons of our poor cannot be put
up at auction as can three millions in your land they can yet be doomed
to the indescribable miseries of semi-starvation. ... I hope our Irish
friends have been on the alert to get you some [autographs] of O’Connell
whilst he was in prison – the nation is now deeply stirred by his
unexpected liberation – every lover of freedom or justice must rejoice
at his triumph over the unfairness by which the proceedings in his case
were marked, & feel thankful at the triumphant vindication of Lord
Denmore of the right of trial by jury ... [more, but hard to read
because of cross-writing.]”
