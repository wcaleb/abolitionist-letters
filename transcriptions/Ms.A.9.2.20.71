[Public dinner was held following O’Connell’s release from prison.
Haughton didn’t attend because alcohol was present.] ... “The very
parties who are loud in their expressions of approval of our teetotal
reformation, & who acknowledge that, but for it, Ireland would not ever
stand in the proud position which she occupies, have neither the virtue
nor the patriotism, to forego the gratification of their sensual apetite
[sic] for intoxicating drinks.”
