Richard Allen to MWC. On Repeal. {BAA version has errors.}

We seem here, i.e. in Dublin, to be in a profound calm. O’Connell is
somewhere, but, at least as far as I hear, not agitating vigorously;
still it is evident that ‘Repeal’ is dear to the people’s hearts; indeed
I believe it grows dearer & dearer, though I think much of what they
expect from it is perfectly Eutopian [sic]. Some counties however
present a serious exception to the general calm, for instance Leitrim &
Cavan are in a sad state of tumult, arising mainly from the oppressively
high price of land; I fear the fault lies mainly at the rich man’s
door.” His small “knot” of Irish reformers has been dubbed
“Everythingarians” by the Evening Mail, a Tory Paper.
