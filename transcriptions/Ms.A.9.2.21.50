GT to [?]. Negative comment on Charles Remond.

“I regret, with you, the coming of Remond. He did not show, when here
before, that disinterestedness which we look for in an apostle of the
American Antislavery Cause. His number-one-ishness was, as I believe you
know, the cause of some little sparrings & differences between us; and
if he be still the same sort of man, I shall feel but little desire to
aid him.” In BAA, Talks briefly about his India work. Has told the
League about Wendell Phillips’s request for pamphlets. Regrets and
deprecates CLR.
