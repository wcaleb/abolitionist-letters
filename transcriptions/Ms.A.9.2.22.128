Lucy Browne to MWC; Bridgewater, Eng.

Wants to know if English public opinion helps abolitionists in US or is
seen as outside interference. Trips of Garrison, Douglass, Burritt and
Clapp “have had a good effect here, in awakening much kind feeling; in
spreading a good deal of information respecting the state of your
country; in rousing a warm interest in your reforms, which I wish we may
not only admire but imitate; and in adding to the list I may almost say
of our personal friends, many on your side of the Atlantic whom although
we may never, indeed probably shall never meet, we shall always hear of
with interest, and think of with affection.”
