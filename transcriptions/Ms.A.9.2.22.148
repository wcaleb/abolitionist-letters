**[1844? 12-11] Ms.A.9.2.22.148**

GT to [MWC]. Letter fragment. Sends copy of speech by Thomas Clarkson
intended for delivery at the opening of the Convention of 1840; the
writer has marked the passages “which were {u}omitted at{/u} the earnest
request of Joseph Sturge” and others. The offending passages had
something to do with sugar duties. Free Churches.

“ ... Government by whatever name called, or however constituted, could
impose without a direct and flagrant violation of the right of free
agents & accountable beings. Though no justification, it would have been
a palliation of such conduct, if it had been combined with active and
energetic exertions for the introduction of the produce of British
India; but such is not the case. As a proof of this, I send you a copy
of a speech as prepared by Thomas Clarkson at his retreat, Playford
Hall, intended to be delivered at the opening of the Convention in 1840,
and I have marked with a black line in the margin, the passages which
were {u}omitted at the Earnest request of Joseph Sturge & some other
members of the Anti Slavery Committee{/u}. I have no expectation that
the monopolists of this country will be able to maintain their ground.
In all probability the discriminating sugar duties will be swept away
during the next session of parliament, & then, if there be any sincerity
in the professions of the Anti Slavery Committee, they will in good
earnest do that which they have hitherto so strangely & unaccountably
neglected & refused to do. Your election being now over, I earnestly
wish you would direct your attention, particularly, to the question
which is always uppermost in my mind; namely, that of affecting Slavery
in your own and other countries by means of the development of the
riches of the soil of India. I will do all I can to second your efforts
in this country.”
