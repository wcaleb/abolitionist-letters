Jeremiah Winslow to MWC; Havre, France

Thanks for two volumes of Liberty Bell and send two French books in
return. He was a resident of New England but has now lived in France for
30 years. “…but I still feel myself an American, a descendant of a
Pilgrim family which valued personal and religious liberty more than
earthly possessions, and I blush for my Country when I reflect that so
large a number of our coloured brethren should be held in bondage by men
who boast of their free institutions, and who consider their country the
only asylum of Liberty. [p] I abhor oppression in any form, whether its
heavy hand fall upon the white serfs, or upon the coloured slave, and I
had hoped that our State Governments would have done something to remove
so foul a blot from the United States, but instead of abolishing the
infamous institution, its dominion is to be extended over what was
formerly free Mexican territory.”
