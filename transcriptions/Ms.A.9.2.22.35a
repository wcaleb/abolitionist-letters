**[1846, 03-29] Ms.A.9.2.22.35a**

Douglass to MWC; Kilmarnock, Scotland

Complains about her lack of confidence in his loyalty to the AASS. Bulk
in {u}BAA{/u}, but ellipsis at the bottom of the first page reads: “Now
Dear Madam you do me great injustice by such comparisons they are direct
insinuations and when whispered in the ear of a stranger to whom I look
up as a friend they are very embarrassing.” The second ellipsis on the
second page reads: “Had you kind friend privious [sic] to my leaving
America given me face to face that advice and friendly counsel which
your long experience, and superior wisdom has richly enabled you to do,
or written to me a kind letter as did my friend Mr Phillips warning me
against the London Committee, my feelings toward you as to him would be
those of ardent gratitude. If you wish to drive me from the Anti Slavery
Society put me under overseership and the work is done. Set some one to
watch over me, for evil, and let them be so simple minded as to inform
me of their office, and the last blow is struck. I have said what I now
have, because I wish you to know just how I feel toward you. I wish to
be candid with my friends. It would have been quite easy to have passed
the matter over had you not sent me the Liberty bell, and made it my
duty to write to you. When I parted from you at the Antislavery office
on the morning of the 16 August 1845, I felt on leaving that you
expected a faithful discharge of my duties abroad. I went forth feeling
my self armed with the confidence reposed in me by yourself and the
Board generally, resolved to do my duty. And although not sustained as I
supposed myself to be, I can thus far challenge the strictest Acounting
into all my movements. I have neither compromised myself nor the
character of my friends. But enough.”
