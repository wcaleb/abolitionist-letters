Douglass to MWC {Most in BAA}

Regarding their quarrel. Much in BAA, but the section omitted by the
first ellipsis reads: “Yours by the kindness of Mr Garrison has reached
me. In reply I beg to state, that I have never for one moment doubted
the purity of intention which led you to write as you did respecting me
to your friend Mr Webb of Dublin. I have not therefore suffered myself
