John Parker Hale to Caroline Weston

Discusses public opinion and politics; praises antislavery pioneers

“I have been trying to arouse the people of Maine to a sense of their
own dangers and duties, but I do not know how far I have succeeded. In
fact I find after all, that I am but a politician, looking for the
developements [sic] of public opinion such as the ballot box gives us,
and trusting mainly to that source for an effectual and practical
reformation of the people. I do not mean to be understood by this as in
the slightest degree disparaging the efforts made in other directions, &
by those entertaining different opinions. I know that men and women of
far different opinions and who have a right to claim the merit of being
the pioneers in this campaign of Humanity have done a work and are now
doing a work in this behalf that throws in the shade the puny efforts of
those who in these latter days come in to reap the fruit of what those
others have sown: I know how mean it must appear to such to witness the
fruits of their exalted, self sacrificing efforts all, or partially,
diverted to the base purposes of party politics. …”
