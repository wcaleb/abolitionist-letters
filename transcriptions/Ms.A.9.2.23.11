Mary Howitt to MWC; Clapton, Eng.

Discusses Garrison’s “scheme of the International Testimony against
slavery” and its proposal to Lovett.

Writes with the same complaint as Lovett, that other people have taken
it upon themselves to assemble the Address against slavery, when it
would have been best left in the hands of Lovett and the Howitts. BAA:
Thinks the international testimony has been mishandled by *People’s
Journal* people.
