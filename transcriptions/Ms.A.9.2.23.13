slavery,” in order to show “that nation the estimation in which she
stands in the eyes of the British people.” Condemns the war with Mexico.

JSM to Henry S. Chapman. 710: “The only propitious circumstances is the
great progress of free trade. Our repeal of the Corn laws is working
wonders; first the great relaxation of the American tariff, next the
triumphal progress of Cobden through Europe. Think of the French
Government authorizing a League (Societe des Libres Exchangite) and
permitting public meetings and speeches. I have great sympathy too with
the fine old Pope. I hope he has many years to live; he is much younger
than Popes usually are, but unhappily they say he has had epileptic fits
when a child, and has had a return of them lately. The priests will
poison him if they can, as they Jesuits are said to have poisoned
Ganganelli. O’Connell is done up, and probably dying, killed, I should
think, by the death of O’Connellism.
