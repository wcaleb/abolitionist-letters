Haughton to MWC

Lengthy letter on numerous topics, including Irish politics. He often
tells “Repealers” in Ireland that unless they sympathize with the
American Negro, they won’t regenerate “their own country.” “It is not
{u}for{/u} freedom they fight, but {u}against{/u} England. So it was
that American[s] fought, not for freedom, but against England. … I send
you Newspapers now & then to let you see what we are doing. We have a
good deal of political action kept up for Repeal of the Union between us
& England. You will see by the Papers that our once great O’Connell is
great no longer. We have no certain accounts of the state of his mind or
body, but I apprehend his mind is broken down, & that this sad result is
caused in great measure by the feeling that he has lost the confidence
of his country, in consequence of his late errors (errors to use the
mildest term) as a politician. His fate is striking evidence of the
folly of a disingenuous course of action.” BAA: Also describes
disunionism as conditional.
