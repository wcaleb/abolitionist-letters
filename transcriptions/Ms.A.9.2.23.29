Talks about the effects of the famine. “I tell you it is a miserable
country for a man to be in, and I would be heartily glad to be well out
of it. The burden of poor laws and so forth are expected to be very
great and most kinds of trade are now particularly dull.” Douglass
treated Buffum “shamefully, like a dog, so that it made me angry to
witness his unfeeling behaviour towards so kind hearted a fellow. And
now for James to swallow all, & go barking, like a spaniel, after
Douglass—it is contemptible. [p] Mazzini got no Liberty Bell, & I have
not one left. If you send one, you should write something in it with
your own hand. Be sure to pester Garrison until he writes to him at
Dripsey Castle, or I’ll be destroyed.” BAA: Haughton is a “corn factor”
accused of being a “monopoliser.” Includes Anti-Irish comments. The
people elicit feelings of “disgust and helplessness.”
