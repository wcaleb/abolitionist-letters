Edmund Quincy to Caroline Weston

Reception for Polk, William Wells Brown, etc.

“It is a long time since I have seen a man, white or black, that I have
cottoned to so much as I have to Brown, on so short an acquaintance. He
is an extraordinary fellow. I do not know that his intellectual power is
equal to that of Douglass, but he is of a much higher cast of character.
There seems to be no meanness, no bitterness, no envy or suspiciousness
about him. His mind seems to be singularly healthy & he never seems (&
he says he never does) [to] think uncomfortably about his being a black
man. … He is the most valuable man we have got since Douglass, & in many
respects he is more valuable than he.” He went to Boston to watch the
reception of President Polk. Complains about something Remond, whom he
derisively nicknames “Toussaint,” did to offend W.W. Brown over money
raised, then continues “Talking of unconscionable niggers, I wrote to
Douglass just as I was living New Bedford, to ask him what he shd
consider a fair compensation for the letters which he had proposed he
shd write for the Standard. In due time I recd an answer, saying that he
shd think {u}two dollars & a half{/u} about right! I consulted Wendell
about it … These niggers, like kings, are “[little?] cattle to shoe
behind,’ & I suppose it is better worth while to pay him $20 or $30 more
than his letters are worth than to put him into a huff, & perhaps sell
them to the Era or the Chronotype.”
