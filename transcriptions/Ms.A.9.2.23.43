Praises the Howitts. Hears that Emerson is coming to England. “From what
I have heard of him, I would greatly like to have him in my house.”
Sends a note of invitation (which is in the Emerson papers at Houghton.
“What do you think of the Pope? In my opinion he is the greatest man in
Europe. I am quite enthusiastic about him, and contrary to my wont, I
read the newspaper regularly for the purpose of seeing what the day
[has?] brought forth to affect his interests. I look on him as a man of
extraordinary wisdom, largeness of view, intelligence, & benevolence,
and it is grand to see the probable regeneration of a nation in
consequence of the resurrection of such a man from the abyss of
degradation in which poor Italy was sunk beneath the repressive, soul
benumbing policy of Austria, that incubus of the Nations.”
