Richard Allen to MWC

Discusses Irish situation. “How my blood is stirred within me when I
think of the wholesale wrong that is inflicted on the country by wicked
& oppressive laws. Think of a country being almost altogether in the
hands of such a class of men as our landlords are—[illegible],
embarrassed with debt, nominally worth thousands a year but living in
splendid beggary, their estates mortgaged to London Jews, the wretched
tenants, committed to the tender mercies of agents whose main aim is, to
collect all the rent they can, totally careless—why should they be
otherwise? of the improvement of the unfortunate tenantry … they care
nothing about them. … But out of evil will spring good! Even now, a
great work is going on, the new poor laws are rapidly effecting an
extensive confiscation of property, the land will rapidly pass from the
hands of its present worthless nominal owners and I trust {u}they{/u}
will be succeeded by a class of at least enlightened {u}money
makers{/u}, through whose enterprize, the population would secure
[illegible] at employment.”
