Farnsworth, Amos, to [MWC]; Boston. “I can hardly imagine how you will
pass your time in France. Lamartine & his coadjutors have already
brought all to a level there. No slavery, no higher, no lower.” Even the
“confounded women question” need not be urged, as women there “play so
conspicuous a part in the business & politics of the nation.”

“I can hardly imagine how you will pass your time in France. Lamartine &
his coadjutors have already brought all to a level there. No slavery, no
higher, no lower classes. And you may not think it necessary to urge on
their attention the ‘confounded woman question,’ as the women now play
so conspicuous a part in the business & politics of the nation. But
there will be much to interest you in witnessing the struggle for right,
the transition state of nations.”
