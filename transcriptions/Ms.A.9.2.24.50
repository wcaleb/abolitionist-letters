Carpenter, Mary, to MWC; Bristol. Expresses admiration for Elihu
Burritt, even if he did lecture for Liberty Party. The writer is “glad
to live at” a period which will be “{u}a world era{/u}.” Comments on the
recent French revolution and on the signs of “free spiritual life” in
Italy, Austria and Russia. 10p.

“With respect to Elihu Burritt, I am glad to learn from your letter that
you, as well as Mr Quincy, are personally unacquainted with him. If you
knew him, you would I think understand him better, & admired with us the
devotedness with which he gives his heart & powers to the cause of human
brotherhood. I have seen him frequently, & read his books: I have seen
nothing in his writings of a compromising character. I have heard
nothing from him but the breathings of a most Christian spirit. I cannot
call him vain or inflated. If he gives us milk & not strong meat, he but
follows the apostolic example in administering food to babes in Christ.
I quite agree with him in {u}not{/u} understanding that the peace of
Christ is a sword, & I rejoice that ‘his still, small voice’ has united
in a League of Brotherhood 20,000 English with as many Americans. ...
[She cannot condemn EB solely because he lectured for the Liberty
Party.] ... How eagerly do we look at the daily papers! I rejoice to
live at a period which will be a {u}world era{/u}. I am not disposed to
congratulate France yet on what many call a glorious revolution; [in
that?] preceding ones have left her little better than before; -- we
have yet to see whether she is [wiser?] than them, -- whether we are to
have a self seeking mobocracy, or a free republic. As yet we see but the
beginning; yet much as I fear from the barbaric love of military
‘glory,’ the fickleness & the vanity, whch [are?] but too prominent in
the French character, I cannot but hope – that she has learnt some
lessons by former experience & that she will rise free & great. She has
begun well in abolishing black as well as white slavery. I rejoice even
more at the signs of free spiritual life which are awakening in Italy,
Austria, & Russia. What wonderful lessons are states now learning! They
are beginning to see if their eyes & ears they have not closed, that
man, the image of his Maker {u}cannot{/u} be trampled on with impunity:
-- that his spirit cannot be quenched: -- that physical force must quail
before moral force: -- that they that take the sword will perish by the
sword. -- & that nations & individuals know with strong faith that the
Lord reigns & that he will avenge the neglect of His laws sooner or
later. – These events must influence the new world; -- they may hasten
the overthrow of the slave power, if it does not perish by a suicidal
hand, which I most expect. – It {u}cannot{/u} live long.”
