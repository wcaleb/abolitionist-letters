RDW to [Caroline Weston?]. ... Until the antislavery cause is better
apprehended in the three kingdoms, it would be looked on as a “piece of
philanthropic knight erranty.” [sic?] Dwells on the ignorance of the
U.S. which prevails in the British isles.

[Has heard that the fight against slavery in DC is not going well.] “I
see by a late number of Douglass paper that the northern members have
succumbed to the south in the Pachecho case and in the case of Slavery
in the District. ... It shows that the interest in the subject in the
free States must be very weak. As long as the public feeling in the
subject of the Corn Laws in England was weak, the landed interest – the
monopolists, had it all their own way – argument, reason, common sense &
justice went for nothing. As soon however as the public mind was reached
& being saturated with free trade arguments began to evince its
conversion. The Landed Interest melted before it like [?] in the sun.
... [An] antislavery Bazaar in any part of the three Kingdoms would be a
failure. It would certainly take way the kind of impulse that impels
many to [work?], if they knew that their productions could be sold in
England or Scotland – and not in America. The Anti Slavery cause don’t
come [home?] to our public even in the way of antagonism – and there is
so much said & properly said about looking at home just now, that I fear
the effort would be looked on in a hostile light by many for this simple
reason. Unless the final bearings of the Anti Slavery cause be
apprehended as I suspect they are by very few in these countries it is
most natural that it should be looked on as a piece of philanthropic
Knight errantry to collect charitable money here by means of a Bazaar to
enable Brother Jonathan to keep from larruping his own niggers. The
ignorance that prevails in these contries about the United States –
their constitution, government, politics, policy, geography, &c. even
amongst the so called educated people is enormous, and I am not sure
that much more credit is given by the abolitionists to the Anti Slavery
spirit of Great Britain than is justly due to it. If the parliament in
1833 had been voting their own money they would not have voted the 20
millions and if the people could have helped themselves they could not
have allowed the plunder. ... [Thinks that moving the Bazaar to England
would also not be wise because ...] I think the moral effect would be
bad both in America & on this side the Atlantic – if the grand effort
for funds were so palpably made out of the Free States on the
monarchical soil of England. You know it was objected to George Thompson
with great force that he was a {u}foreign{/u} incendiary. [Talks about
the heavy postage of bringing Standards to England, even if subscribers
could be found, but is glad that the postage is soon to be reduced.]
