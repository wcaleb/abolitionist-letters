RDW to MWC; [Dublin] to Paris. Discusses French invasion of Italy, etc.

“In looking over my store of tracts, I found one copy of the Declaration
of Sentiments & Constitution of the Nonresistance Society, which I now
enclose. ... I cannot [indeed ??] admire the pluck you evince in
contemplating French translations of these documents. You must have
large hopes, when you anticipate success in an appeal to the French
conscience on the subject of war. This invasion of the Roman Republic
with the consent of the National Assembly is enough to disgust one, not
merely with French humanity but with humanity itself – it is enormously
mean, cruel, & inconsistent. Two years ago I would not have believed
that French republicans would have consented to send a French expedition
to force reluctant republicans back again under the degrading monarchy
of a despotic priest. It is pretty plain that this infamous expedition
is undertaken with the hearty good will of the English government – but
this is only natural. It is only consistent that a grasping & selfish
aristocracy like ours who care for nothing in comparison with the
maintenance of their own firm seat upon John Bulls shoulders, should do
their utmost as [?] far as they could do for the preservation of all the
despotisms by which Europe is afflicted. ... When the French get the
Romans down, I suppose they will join Austria & Russia against the
Hungarian [?]. It makes me heart sick when I look on the politics of
Europe just now. I wonder how the French talk – what do they say about
Louis Napoleon and his doings at the expense of their blood & treasure,
and reputation?” [Richard and Ann Allen will probably call on MWC in the
summer; Webb describes Richard as very prosperous as a clothier, but not
as dedicated to the cause as he could be since becoming so wealthy. SHG
sent him the Bigelow Papers.]
