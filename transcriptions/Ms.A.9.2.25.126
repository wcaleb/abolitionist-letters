**[1851, 10-11] Ms.A.9.2.25.126**

Mary Estlin to AWW

New organization. “At present we msut go on with the war of
extermination against New Organization, in which I do believe, if Mr W.
Phillips & you would come & unite, it might be brought to a victorious
issue in the course of the next twelve months. … However I must not lead
you to suppose I am getting demented on the theme by perpetually harping
on it; only I want you to know the extreme difficulty we have in making
English people, especially quakers, understand that it is {u}not{/u} the
most enlarged kind of Antislavery to help & co-operate with ‘{u}all
parties{/u},’ that this really means pulling down with one hand what you
build up with the other, & in fact attempting to serve God & Mammon. …”
Intimations that she thinks all the internecine quarreling should be
tamped down.
