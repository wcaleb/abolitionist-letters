RDW to AWW; Dublin. The writer is concerned about Kossuth ...

“By the kindness of Miss Estlin I have seen a letter from your sister
Caroline written since Louis Napoleons gigantic villainy exploded and
assuring us of the safety of our friends. I look upon this Coup d’Etat
as one of the most horrible crimes on all [the history’s?] page. This
wretch had nothing to [?] his villainy. He must come to a miserable end
in some way or other. ... I dont know why I mulled to tell you of
Kossuth. Probably I had been writing so much about him that I thought
you might read if you pleased, it seemed [?] to say any more on the
subject. We have heard of his arrival. In a few days we will know all
about his behavior. If he is silent about slavery he will be so
deliberately – for no pains were spared from many quarters to make the
whole matter clear to him. I had a copy of Am. Slavery as it is placed
in his hands. Could you send me 3 or 4 copies of that book in the [Box]?
-- & let me know the price. – We have been looking out for Whittier’s
mean poem. Do you mean (that is no pun) the lines addressed to Kossuth?
– and the compliment to dead John Q. Adams instead of the living
Garrison ... The new Glasgow [?] have just sent us (wherefore I do not
know) a copy of their first Report. They call themselves the ‘{u}Glasgow
Female New Association for the Abolition of Slavery{/u}.’ It contains a
good deal of cant – cooperates with the N.Y. Vigilance Committee &
contains a speech from Garnet in which he lauds the Am. & F. A.S.
Society, accuses Thompson of misrepresentation & glorifies the new Broad
Street Society. What do you think of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ in the National
Era. Is it not a very good story?”
