“ ... an extreme popularity. No mention is made of abolitionists as far
as I have seen, and the writer appears desirous of showing up the
weakness of slavery irrespective of the efforts of others for its
overthrow.” He has felt anxious about her and her family since hearing
of events in Paris. “You have indeed been almost eye witness of one of
the shocking and soul sinking events in all history—one which seems to
put back indefinitely the hope of the world & of the progress of
humanity.” The prevailing opinion in England and Ireland is now that “a
coalition of the four great despots of the continent is extremely
probable.” He is more and more admiring of the English people as he sees
more of other countries. Discusses Kossuth’s dereliction. “It is
disgusting to see such praises lavished on the greedy, conceited,
slave-hunting New Yorkers—who say liberty exists nowhere else—we are the
only people who understand government—we must teach the world.” Has been
following Uncle Tom’s Cabin.
