“…Political affairs are {u}lively{/u} in England at present, but when I
read the accounts of these crises in America, the quietness &
{u}security{/u}, & absence of violent personalities with which changes
are affected here, are very [illegible]. Our various political parties
at this moment, all unite in feeling the difficulty … Our struggle is
chiefly between the free trade & protectionist parties, the head of the
latter, Lord Stanley, has failed to form a Ministry. There is too great
a notion in this country that all political wisdom, & legislatorial
skill must centre in Lords & Baronets. My political wishes go to a
greater extension of the suffrage, & to a vote by ballot. In
{u}French{/u} politics I can get up no interest, not enough hardly to
look at the Paris news. The {u}republican{/u} army to restore the Pope,
has given me a thorough hopelessness of any noble or honest political
principle being carried out in France during the present century. … I
have volunteered into a sort of {u}fray{/u} with Mrs Richardson, Mary
says most audaciously, & with no tangible cause. But I hear so many
({u}more{/u} than) surmises of her hostility to the ‘Am. A. S. Socy’,
such patronage of those known to be opposed to it, & all in such a
violent unacknowledged way, that taking a legitimate opportunity of
giving her my views on her pet scheme, (that dreadful {u}sham{/u} the
{u}Free labour Movement{/u},) I put before her the claims of the ‘Am.
Soc.’ & W. L. G. to support, & the worthless course of our ‘B. & F. A.
S. Soc.,’ in no ambiguous language. I had too in view, by a strong
expression of my sentiment, some latent hope that it might cause
obstruction to Garnet’s intended visit hither, to talk his nonsense
about freeing the Slaves by the quaker Ladies giving up the use of dress
made with Am. cotton! This coming {u}was{/u} fixed, but he is not yet
here. Mr. Webb avoided him in Dublin. Mr. Webb’s visit of a couple of
days a fortnight ago, was most refreshing to us.”
