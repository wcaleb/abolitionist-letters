GT to [Anne Weston]

Meeting with Gerrit Smith, whom he praises; meetings in Syracuse;
Fugitive Slave Law. He stays a few night’s with Smith. “This man has not
had justice done him by the dear friends of ours in the East. … Mr Smith
gave a lecture before the Syracuse ‘Free Trade League.’ The address was
an able exposition of Mr. Smith’s views on the subject of Government. In
almost all he said I found myself concurring, and my afterthoughts have
only confirmed my opinion of the general accuracy of his theory.” He
delivers a speech about the progress of the cause. “Once, if the world
heard any thing of the Anti-Slavery movement here they believed it was
confined to half-a-dozen hot-headed fanatics and a few silly women. Now
Europe rung with execrations against America for her fugitive slave law
and every breeze wafted to the camp of the true American Israel the
prayer of millions—‘Heaven defend the right!’” Talks about the presence
of five fugitive slaves at one of the meetings in Syracuse, two of whom
“had reached Mr. May’s the night before, and three fine young men (two
of them brothers) who had been brought here on Tuesday by R. Purvis of
Philadelphia who came all the way to see me. These five fugitives were
ranged on tables in the view of the entire audience. A series of the
most searching questions was put to the people by Mr. May respecting the
fugitive slave law, and these five persons. … The names of the parties
willing to take the fugitives to their houses were fearlessly
proclaimed. When they were told of the possible consequences of their
act the bold answer was let Fillmore make the most of it.” He is to
lecture on “India and British Reforms.”
