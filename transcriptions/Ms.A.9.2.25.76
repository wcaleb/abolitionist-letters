EPN to [Weston?]

Discusses Fugitive Slave Law, political situation in USA, etc.

Says the framers of the Fugitive Slave Law will live in contempt by
posterity. They have sanctioned the return of slaves “into a bondage far
more cruel than is to be found under the greatest despots of Europe.”
She wonders whether the Law “is likely to lead to some dreadful crisis
which will end in a disruption of the Union, or whether the tyrant,
thro’ the force of public sentiment will have to relax his grasp on the
Northern States [who] consent to be the tools of the South & quietly
submit to the encroachments of the Slaveholders & their supporters.”
