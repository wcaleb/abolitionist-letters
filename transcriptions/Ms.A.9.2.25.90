EPN to [MWC]. Discusses the Paris Peace Congress. ... Does not want
England to become a republic. Would like to see certain radical reforms
carried out in England.

“But from our friends I was disappointed to find that there is little if
any prospect of seeing you in England this summer as a remark in thy
letter had led me to hope. Let me only assure thee that whenever you do
visit our land, it will afford me the sincerest pleasure to see you at
Darlington & to make you as comfortable as we can under our roof. In
saying so I always feel how entirely the pleasure must be on my side, &
how truly a benevolent motive can [alone?] activate those who kindly
give up their time for my gratification, for all I possess is a
{u}sincere heart{/u} in the cause of humanity & towards those friends
whom it has united me with in spirit. ... You will of course make a
point of being in Paris at the time of the Peace Congress, from what I
hear it can hardly fail to be a deeply interesting occasion – Lamartine
President & our own Cobden Vice President. I have not heard who are
likely to attend from this country but no doubt many who would be most
interested in meeting with thee & in the case of some, doubtless the
pleasure wd be mutual. I think thou wouldst be particularly pleased with
Henry Vincent [moral force Chartist]. He was here lately & gave an
admirable lecture on Religious Liberty. I [?] our ‘unique’ friend Ann
Knight will be there to agitate her ‘womanism’ (as she calls it) amongst
the members in private. I can go a considerable way with her but far
from the whole length. ... I can well suppose that the present must be a
deeply interesting time to be in Paris, especially so to a republican or
one who at least has so long lived under that form of Govt. So it would
to me, for I strongly sympathize with those views – altho’ I have no
desire to see a revolution in this country to effect such a change here
– we have every reason so far as my knowledge extends to be well content
with our Queen – but I would rejoice to see some radical reforms carried
out – sinecures cut off & most of the salaries to our state paupers
reduced in half [when?] in many cases taken away [all by others?]. The
[Traits?] [marked?] by the Liverpool Financial Reform Asson are
enlightening the country greatly & B.W. Noel’s excellent book, with
Shore’s imprisonment & Noel’s {u}threatened{/u} prosecution are opening
the eyes of numbers to the evils of a state church who never thought on
the subject before & arousing many more to active exertion, who were
previously slumbering over the Grievance. We are endeavoring, I trust,
in the right direction in this country & shall I fondly hope be spared
the awful scares of bloodshed which have been enacted on the Continent.
Germany is now joining in the cry for liberty & truly the Sovereigns of
Europe – many of them – remind me of Pharaoh of old, whose heart was
hardened. It seems as tho’ they were given up to blindness, in refusing
the reasonable demands of the people & causing their own thrones to
totter to the foundation. One cannot but contemplate the happenings of
the last fifteen months with very mingled feelings – the awakening to
Liberty is a healthful & a delightful sign of better times coming when
the bodies & the souls of men will be emancipated from the thraldom
[sic] in which they are, to so great an extent held, but the
{u}means{/u} used to obtain it must be deplored. Yet even the
[resistance?], which in some instances has been [shown?], to the
{u}needless{/u} shedding of blood, as they wd term it, bespeaks a
greater regard for human life. After all, I think, our doings in India,
& the terrible slaughtering there have been far more inexcusable &
disgraceful to a nation professing Xty. Ah! [or Oh!] When will the reign
of peace on Earth & good will to man arrive?”
