Gerrit Smith to Anne Weston

Declines a request to write for a “’Garrisonian’ book”

“I must decline your request not from any reluctance to write for a
‘Garrisonian’ Book, for I count myself to be a ‘Garrisonian’ in all the
essentials of a ‘Garrisonian.’ I must decline it because on account of
my excessive private business, I have to decline every such request.
