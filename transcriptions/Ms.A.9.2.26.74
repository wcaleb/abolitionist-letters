MWC to Caroline Weston; Paris

Essay intended for publication in the Liberty Bell entitled “Russia &
the Russians.” “An admirable work bearing the above title, on the
condition & prospects of Russia, was published in Paris in 1847, by
Monsieur Tourgueneff. This accomplished gentleman is a Russian noble,
exiled & under sentence of death since 1825, for having cast in his lot
with the serfs by advocating their emancipation while Minister of
Finance & member of the emperor’s Council of State. He is one of those
truly wise & good men whose opinions cannot fail to have great influence
wherever they are known. With him Freedom is a question of Fundamental
right as well as of national policy. After reading certain copies of the
Liberator & Standard, & Uncle Tom’s Cabin which I sent him he addressed
to me the following letter, which I entreated permission to publish
here. I am convinced that a body of good men of all countries who should
be at the same time great enough to create for themselves a sphere of
moral action, higher than that of national policy & founded on the
deepest principles of universal & absolute right, would soon be able to
change the moral aspect of the world, & abolish such institutions as
serfdom & slavery. [p] It is to make such men acquainted with each other
for such a purpose, that the ‘Liberty Bell’ is published.” In attached
note to Caroline, talks about French translations of *Uncle Tom’s
Cabin*.
