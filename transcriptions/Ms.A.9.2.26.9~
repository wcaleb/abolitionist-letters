**[1852, 02-09] Ms.A.9.2.26.9**

EPN to AWW?; Ben Rhydding. Discusses Kossuth; describes Mazzini.
Comments on political situation in Europe. Describes recent travels,
including her attendance at the last sitting of the Peace Congress & her
visit to the Great Exhibition, and Bristol, where she became personally
acquainted with the Estlins. Laments that she didn’t get to meet MWC
before she left from London to Paris, and hopes on her return trip she
will meet her.

“I read his [WP’s] speech on Kossuth’s career in America with perfect
delight & have sent the paper on visits to several of my friends in
different parts of the country, to let them see how meanly he has
shirked the question of liberty in your land, proving himself to be not
a lover of freedom for all, but for his own country merely. Surely,
patriotism is as WP. says, essentially selfish. I have been thinking
whether it wd not be worth while to have the speech printed & circulated
on {u}this{/u} side the Atlantic. My ‘Liberator which contains it – that
for Jany. 2. will be pretty well worn out with its travels. May I ask
thee to send me another copy? for I must not be without it. ... Oh! one
treat I had in London was to dine & spend an eveg. with Mazzini – at
[Munswell Hill?] – where WLG & many others on your side will remember
spending so pleasant a sabbath eveg. in 1840. Mazzini is indeed a noble,
striking looking person – such an {u}eye{/u} I never saw in any other
person – so full of fire – so penetrating & yet so {u}mild{/u}. I
{u}cannot{/u} think {u}he{/u} would have acted as Kossuth has regarding
American Slavery.”
