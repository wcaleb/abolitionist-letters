Richard Allen to [MWC?]

Praises UTC. “I rejoice to see thee looking at matters so hopefully, so
strong in the faith that the cause is progressing. For my part, I have
never indulged in despair. Little as I have done, it was always in a
hopeful spirit, in the conviction that labour must tell. … But to me the
great, overpowering thought is, the position to which America is reduced
by her great sin, the terrible darkness which overspreads her, mentally
& religiously, her teachers of religion proving from {u}that{/u} book,
which tells above all others of the equality of man, whose whole tenor
breathes boundless love, compassion, brotherly kindness, mutual
forbearance, patience forgiveness, that the system as opposed to its
teachings as light is to darkness is sanctioned by it, is to me
fearfully appalling. Oh! America America to what depths art thou
fallen!”
