Steinthal to Mary Estlin

Re: Kossuth etc. “Do you know anything of the German Newspaper which was
or is published in Washington by the American and Foreign Anti Slavery
Society. I think it is the only means of Antislavery Information,
directed especially to the German Immigrants into the States, and I
should be glad to hear that it is a good paper, although the quarter
whence it comes, does not augur well for its soundness. A Hungarian
friend of mine who is going over to the States soon has been indirectly
asked to become a contributor, and I should not be surprised if he does
give his aid, unless he hears something very strong against it. I think
he is fairly indoctrinated with AntiSlavery views. He met Mr. McKim when
here, and was very much pleased with him. He quite agrees with what the
Abolitionists say of Kossuth’s American behaviour, & regrets very much
that he went out of his way to make a hollow alliance with the
Slaveholding power.”
