Various subjects, including European politics. Mazzini vs. Kossuth.

“I have this morning received the Pennsylvania Freeman from [?], giving
an account of the 2^nd^ Decade Meetings. It seems to have been an
interesting assembly. I am glad to see that both W. Phillips and Mr
Quincy have a clear perception of the difference between European and
American oppression. I am no defender of tyranny wherever it be found,
can appreciate the wrongs of Ireland, Hungary, Italy and Poland, but it
is a mere mockery and misuse of language to compare even the sufferings
of Poland and Hungary to the wrongs which the coloured people have to
endure. They are still treated as men, they are not property, and
domestic ties are considered sacred still. Joseph [Burke?] ought to be
ashamed of comparing the Injustice of the Corn Laws to the Slave system
but he never saw his way very clearly to my mind while he was in
England, as to the true evils of European Politics. [p] There I must say
I think all things look promising enough. I do not fear that the
[demise?] of Union manifested by Broad Street will do us any harm, for I
fancy the eyes of most true abolitionists are open to the shortcomings
of past days, and [Mr.?] Chamerovzow is sincere and honest. [Chamer. has
written asking whether his Bridgewater society would affiliate with
Broad Street; S. declined because he didn’t want to have to withdraw
later if the Society took turns they disapproved of.] ... We shall have
the best test of their sincerity at the Conference to be held in London
this next summer. If that is thoroughly abolitionist in spirit, there is
hope in Quakerdom yet. ... I often venture to tell my friends here, they
have no right to speak so strongly about slavery, while they are doing
nothing to improve the state of things at home. It is so easy for us
Englishmen to speak against slavery in America, but we have no right to
do so unless we are active on our own shores in the removal of evil.
Consistency is a great virtue in Reformers; without it they are
continually giving their oponents [sic] a handle against them. Look at
Kossuth: People may talk about his sincerity as doubtful and his best
friends are compelled to lament his shortcomings in America, while
Mazzini is respected because he is thoroughly consistent; not content
with opposing tyranny in Italy; he can feel for the wrongs others are
enduring elsewhere. And yet consistency is a virtue few of us can lay
claim to: It is a great pity, and to this weakness in ourselves I fear
we must lay the blame, if our success in great objects has not been as
great as we could have desired. [He believes the AASS is one of the most
consistent moral reforms of the day, unlike the Churches.]
