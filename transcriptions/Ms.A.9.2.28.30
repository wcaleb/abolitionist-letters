**[1854, 11-15] Ms.A.9.2.28.30**

RDW to MWC. Regarding position of upper classes in England.

“My belief respecting the English Upper Class ever since 1849 has been
that its sympathies are strongly with any despotism against any
assertion of popular rights, that might however remotely discredit &
endanger their own position as the ruling class in Great Britain.”
