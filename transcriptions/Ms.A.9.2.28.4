Re: Douglass. “Enclosed you have all the passages referring to Douglass,
in the way of warning or comment on his character that I have been able
to find in your letter. … No. 1 must be the letter so often referred to.
It was written before D. came over. Your letter introducing him & Buffum
is dated Aug 14.45, and is merely formal. No. 2, dated Oct. 27, 45,
shows you how soon I gave you some of my [views?] of his character.
Indeed he was not many days our guest, before I saw he was a self-seeker
and grossly ungrateful, for his conduct to Buffum was insolent &
unfeeling. My admiration of his ability never slackened, but I have
ceased to feel much warmth or confidence towards him. If I ever read him
or showed him any part of your letter to me, it must have been in Sept
45, and judging from my own habits & what I would be likely to do with
them I had no special confidence in, I cannot think I ever felt towards
Douglas in such a way as to show him such a mark of my estimate of his
good sense & forbearance. In No. 5, dated Mar 1, 46, in which you imply
your disapproval of my having shown your letter or read parts of it to
Douglass, you say that you told D. the drift of what you wrote me before
he left home, & you think I showed less than my usual tact in showing
your letter or reading part of it to him. … [Douglass] began to look on
me as a spy set over him by you. This all {u}might{/u} have easily
happened without a breach of confidence, tact, & good sense on my part …
The whole strain of these extracts shows that you measured him very
soon, and that from an early time you felt uncomfortable about him. At
the very first meeting he held in Dublin, I saw that he looked to
himself, and as I did a great deal for him gratuitously, for which I got
insolence and no thanks (tho, in the only letter I ever had from [him]
since his return to the U.S., he admitted he had done me {u}some
injustice{/u}) he was very soon beyond the pale of that sympathy on my
part which induces me to show any one the confidential letters I
receive.”
