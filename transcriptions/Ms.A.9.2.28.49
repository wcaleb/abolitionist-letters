Their views on violence and war; Crimean War

“Your views on {u}fighting{/u} interest me as well as those on
resignation, from their giving another indication of the contrast there
is between us. You ‘{u}believe{/u} in peace & yet sympathise with
fighting.’ I believe in peace & therefore have {u}no sympathy
whatever{/u} with anything pertaining to war. I know that out of man’s
evil God educes good, & therefore I have faith that all the butchery now
going forward may help on some victory of a righteous principle, & that
thus perhaps in some way a door may be opened for the oppressed nations
of Europe to regain their freedom. But ignorant as I am of the means by
which this much to be desired end will be brought about I cannot awaken
in myself any enthusiasm or sympathy in the war. The {u}rulers{/u} of
all the people who are taking part in the struggle seem to care more for
themselves than for their neighbours, & their aristocratic predilections
make them unconcerned for the wrongs of Hungary, Poland, or Italy. The
conservative spirit predominates, & I suspect the English government
would greatly prefer seeing the Czar conquer, to these ill-used states
regaining their liberties. I cannot therefore feel any satisfaction in
the immediate issue of any battles in the Crimea nor in the ascendancy
of one power & defeat of the other. Moreover I have no faith in the
permanence of apparent good which is attained by bloodshed & violence,
or any unholy measures, tho I do believe that ultimately these things
may be proved stepping stones to some good end.”
