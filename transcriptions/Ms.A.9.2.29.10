Mary Estlin to Caroline Weston

Looks forward to meeting her. Estlin, Webb, and others don’t think it is
wise to focus on new/old divisions in England. Discusses Crafts,
Pennington, Garnet. Although she thinks it is appropriate to level
epithets at “new organization” in America, it “would have the contrary
effect of spreading the infection {u}here{/u}, where 99 out of 100
professedly Antislavery people can never be induced to examine for
themselves into the merits of the question, but take all statements upon
hearsay. These 99 are for the most part pupils of Scoble & Sturge &
their religious sympathies are at once enlisted by the cant of the New
Organizationists … If all these [old organization] allies were to adopt
Mr Paton’s course, & noisily proclaim in season & out of season the
claims of that Society & the sins of its opponents, irrespective of the
tone, temper, & degree of enlightenment of each audience, they would at
once frighten away the 99 who are now useful auxilliaries [sic] … I will
send you either now or in a day or two a letter just received from Miss
Wigham with whose troubles {u}we{/u} have been expressing our sympathy,
& who we believe chose the least of two evils in her conduct relative to
the Edinburgh Soiree. Brown & Craft certainly acted precisely as we
should have done in their circumstances. They maintain that they could
not do otherwise than conform to the wishes of those whom they knew to
be Mr Garrison’s best friend in the course prescribed for them. They
expressed their own opinions to Miss W. but considered her judgement
superior to their own, from her intimate acquaintance with the parties
with whom she had to deal. And she showed them how the {u}Pennington
adorers{/u} who composed the majority of the assembly would have been
roused to open hostility by his being excluded from the platform, while
{u}he{/u} would have used this handle to damage the faithful. {u}Now{/u}
he has {u}exposed himself{/u} by his pecuniary transactions & his
attacks of {u}insanity{/u} wh came on opportunely to relieve his
embarrassments will no longer avail. Henson too will we hope soon be set
aside, & then Garnet will be our chief remaining antagonist among the
{u}colored ministers{/u} (to all of whom {u}we{/u} have the strongest
aversion,) & he has had already sundry intimidations, & hints to take
care how he plays with edged tools.” Praises the Crafts, particularly
Ellen, and W. W. Brown.
