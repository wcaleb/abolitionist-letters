Irish popery; India better under British rule than native rulers.
Discusses the Mutiny. “I do not know what the real importance is of
India to England, or vice versa. I have met nobody to tell me. I don’t
know how much worse off we should be if we lost India altogether. But I
imagine to hold India will be a much more costly & difficult theory in
practice. I imagine the people are better off under England than they
would be under their native rules, as I am sure Ireland is better ruled
as a part of England than if she were independent & eaten up or ground
down by Romish priests, & yet it is the case that a vast number of Irish
Catholics would much rather have the Priests & the Inquisition than
Queen Victoria, & so I suppose it would be with the Indian natives. I am
very little of an Englishman & yet I think it would be better the
mutinies should be suppressed than triumphant—better I mean for the
swarming millions of the Peninsula. If England be eventually successful
she will I imagine learn a lesson of moderation that could be taught her
in no other way. I regard the English & American people as essentially
domineering & intolerant. The mass of English, British, Irish, Scotch
society is insolent whenever it has gained wealthy or position—the
tendency is to look down upon & walk over their supposed inferiors. I
abhor this spirit.”
