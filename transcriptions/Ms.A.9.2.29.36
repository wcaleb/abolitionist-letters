Discourses at length on British rule in India.

“As to this Indian mutiny my mind is going through a great revolution by
means of it. I at first regarded it as merely a military revolt, and in
common with most others I regarded the massacre and tales of horror and
violence with angry disgust. Since then I have read a good deal and I am
disposed to think that the English are regarded in the whole with great
dislike in India, that the sympathy of the people was with the
mutineers, & that it is not probable, although the rebellion as it is
called may be put down, that Great Britain will ever so far recover her
prestige as to succeed in making willing subjects of the natives. I
believe that the prejudice against colour, and dislike and contempt
towards the natives as blacks and aliens is too strong to be easily
eradicated. I don’t think the country can ever be safely governed by
England except despotically, and this being so, it can never be ruled by
her with the good will off the people and their priests & native
princes. Whatever the English writers may say of ruling the country in
such a way as to secure its best interests, I believe they have up to a
very recent time been beneficent, disinterested, & generous exactly as
Alexander, Caesar, & Napoleon always claimed to be. They talk of making
the people Christians. They will never succeed. Was ever a [map of
nations? Mass of natives?] made religious by such preaching or converted
by such arguments as they have to offer side by side with such examples?
I believe the Indian Mahomedans and followers of Bramah are just as
factual & have as satisfactory arguments to offer us … & where would the
use be of reasoning with him, who venerates St Dominick & regards Loyola
as one of the chief champions of Christianity! The English have ruled
India selfishly, as they have until lately governed Ireland. Now no
country in the world enjoys a more beneficent, considerate government
[than] Ireland, in no country is there greater political or religious
liberty—and yet I am confident that if Ireland were polled, a majority
of the people (an ignorant & fanatically popish majority, it must be
said) would vote for the government of Louis Napoleon in preference. The
priests have the people in their hands and a very bad use they make of
them. The common English are a much less moral & amiable race than
ours—but they are far more truthful & manly, greater lovers of fair
play.”
