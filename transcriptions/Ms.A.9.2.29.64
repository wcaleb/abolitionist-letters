Samuel J. May to Caroline Weston; Florence, Italy

Sounds as if he visited Theodore Parker in Rome? Or probably Lucia
Weston? He refers to a dear acquaintance there but doesn’t give a name.
“At Arezzo we received tidings of the Revolution in Tuscany, and, there
and all along the road thereafter, we witnessed the enthusiasm of the
people in the cause of Italy. We found Florence rather quiet, for a city
that had just dismissed her sovereign and initiated a revolution. The
inhabitants were all in the streets and their countenances shone with
the consciousness of a high purpose. Tri-colored rosettes were
conspicuous on their hats or their bosoms, and the tricolored flags were
floating from the towers of the old & the newer Ducal palaces, and from
the military stations. Young men were running to the offices for
enlistment and giving themselves up to the service of Italy. But with
all this there was little noise. The current of public sentiment and
feeling seemed to meet with no obstructions, and therefore, though deep
and strong, it flowed on silently. [p] We know very little of what is
going on at the seat of war. Reports that come one day are contradicted
the next. But a terrible conflict is undoubtedly pending and all Europe
may ere long be embroiled.” Much to his surprise he found a copy of the
NASS of April 16 at his Banker’s. He enjoyed reading about Sarah
Remond’s lectures but was sorry to see that the Personal Liberty Bills
in NY and Mass. had failed.
