RDW to Editor of the *Giornale [?] di Roma*. Printed sheet titled “The
Neapolitan Exiles in Ireland.”

Suggests raising a fund to enable Italian refugees to return to
Sardinia.

“Sir, A large majority of Irish politicians belong to the ‘Liberal’
party. The remainder—the ‘Conservatives’—claim to be equally attached to
our constitutional monarchy, and to the priceless blessings of civil and
religious liberty which it secures to us. Under these circumstances I
would suggest that a noble opportunity now offers for us all to give
practical proof of the sincerity of our principles. The illustrious and
innocent victims of the perjured tyrant of Naples have just taken refuge
on our shores, and are desirous, as I learn from the newspapers, to
return to the only part of their native Italy where they will be allowed
to reside unmolested and with a chance of being rejoined by the
relatives from whom they have been so long cruelly separated. As these
unfortunate men are guiltless of any offence against the laws or
religion of their native land; as they have suffered for their fidelity
to that constitution which the King of Naples himself swore to maintain;
as they are I believe all of the same creed as three-fourths of the
people of Ireland … I cannot doubt that there will be a general
disposition to carry out my proposition. That is, that an association or
associations [be immediately formed—*handwritten addition*]—the more
numerous, various, and widely extended the better—for the purpose of
welcoming Baron Poerio and his fellow-exiles to our shores, of
ministering to their wants during their stay, and of assisting them in
returning promptly, safely, and comfortably to Italy. As it is pretty
certain that these martyrs of liberty will be enthusiastically welcomed
in England also … I hope we shall not be behindhand in any of these
particularities. …”
