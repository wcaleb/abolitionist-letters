Gerrit Smith to Robert Purvis

Expresses love for Garrison and Phillips despite disagreements. “It is
true, as you say, that we differ widely in our interpretation of the
Fed. Constitution. But surely our difference should not be allowed to
impair our mutual respect & mutual love. I honor & love Garrison &
Phillips--& none the less because their legal interpretation of the
Constitution is not my own. [p] Nothing as much as the mutual
intolerance of its friends has hindered the progress of the antislavery
cause.”
