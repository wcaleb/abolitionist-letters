Weston, Caroline, to Deborah Weston. The writer begins with a long
explanation of why she didn’t write a letter about the unexpected
arrival of Chapmans from Haiti. The Chapmans had both been sick. Tells
about their experiences in Haiti. RDW sent the manuscript of the longest
work DO’C ever published, to the Abos for sale.

“This you will wish to know – The short & long of it was between
{u}ourselves{/u} Henry got to such a patch of uneasiness that he
{u}would{/u} not stay any longer. He & M. were both attacked at Port Au
Prince with a {u}Diarreah{/u} (entre nous) which is the alternative with
yellow fever, & were ill all the time. H feared I know by what I gather
that it was an alarming feature of his complaint -- & he threatened to
go home in a hogshead of {u}rum{/u} – all this however is not to be
[spoke?] of – he was then in no situation to go [land?] to the Cape &
the Haitian craft by sea were {u}unbearable{/u}. ... I am only sorry
that in consequence of his indisposition they saw very little of Port Au
Prince & had no interview with Boyer at all. Henry say [Inyenac?
Ingenac?] thrice – they had 14 days home & one storm – Henry looks thin
but his cough is far less annoying as far as I can observe than when
they went away. ... Richard Webb is very [?] & interesting of course –
he has sent a manuscript of the longest work O’Connell ever published &
which as he printed it – was left in his hands & he sends it to us with
O.Cs permission. R.W. hopes it will sell for $25 & wishes the money may
be given to Rogers.”
