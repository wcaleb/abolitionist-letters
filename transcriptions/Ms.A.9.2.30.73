Ricketson to Deborah Weston; New Bedford

Discusses Italian exiles to the U.S. Garibaldi, Maggi, etc.

“Major Maggi, is an Italian Exile, of Noble Birth, has been a teacher of
French in this city for seven or eight Years, giving great satisfaction,
is an excellent scholar, and a thorough abolitionist. I have written him
and sent Liberators, & Anti Slavery Standards to him while at Fort
Munroe. He went with our company as a private, having declined a
Lieutenancy which was offered him, was promoted three times during the
short stay. He was seven years in the Military School at Turin, and was
also seven years in the army, three of which was in actual service, was
an adjutant under Garibaldi, is 37 years old, wounded in the leg by a
musket ball at [Louvaro?], came over to America with Garabaldi [sic],
and was with him in South America, where he was wounded in the side by a
sabre. He & Edw[ar]d L Piece had the charge of the colored fugitives
(they are not contrabands) at Fortress Munroe. He says Genl Butler
wanted the slaves to do more work than the whites, but he overruled him
& made him also give them the same Rations. … There is also another
young Italian about 20 years old who has been in the country one month
named Luigi [Contri?], with the highest credentials from Garabaldi [sic]
… Spent the evening with us Thursday, like Maggi, he says he has come to
fight against slavery & is a thorough Abolitionist. When our troops came
back, Maggi & Young Contri, both wore the Garabaldi Uniform & they both
looked magnificently.”
