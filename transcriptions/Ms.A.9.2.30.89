RDW to [Caroline Weston?]

Defends British attitude about the War. {Some in {u}BAA{/u}.}

“Although your opinions are very positive, I do not think you have had
sufficient grounds for [forming] a reliable estimate of the English
people. Your intercourse with them has been peculiarly one sided, and
exactly among that aristocratic & upper commercial class who have been
most exposed to evil influences. I mean by evil influences the society
and sentiments of that immense proportion of traveled Americans, North &
South, who, as you well know, are not & never until lately have in any
way affected to be {u}abolitionists{/u}. I don’t see how it was possible
that the lessons of this respectable, well dressed, well introduced, &
frequently accomplished & well educated multitude of proslavery
lecturers, preachers, instructors, disseminators could fail in producing
a powerful influence where ever they had access. … The very classes you
know most of in England are those who having been most exposed to the
contamination have suffered most from it. Writers for the press,
literary men & those classes to whom traveled Americans have most wished
for and obtained access. [p] That many of our newspapers have shown
proslavery [illegible] & therefore Southern tendencies is true. How
could it be helped with such & so much proslavery teaching, I do not
see.” From BAA: “I have always thought that owing chiefly to the
circumstances of their education there was infinitely less international
hatred towards America in England than there is towards England in
America. I firmly believe that if the war had been a bonafide
anti-Slavery war instead of a way which may turn out on the slave’s [?]
by accident & against the intention of the Northern people, a degree of
enthusiasm would have been called forth in England like that which
attended with breathless interest & sympathy the progress of Garibaldi
from Marsala to Naples.”
