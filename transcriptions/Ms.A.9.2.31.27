MWC to Anne Greene Chapman

Describes her political position. “I am not, in my own secret heart,
proud of my country while its salvation depends upon the resolutions of
its enemies:--but I am thankful that it could be {u}kicked{/u} into line
with free nations, in season to prevent its becoming a common nuisance.
I am one in heart with the blind masses of our people, who themselves so
devotedly for the Unity of the country, & I would do {u}any{/u} thing
that was not wrong, to enlighten them so that they could not be made the
tools of selfish demagogues at every Election. … I have my own earnest
wishes,--that America might be {u}one{/u} from the Northern to the
Southern Arctic by means of Freedom: & that Europe might be so
magnetically drawn to the happiness & goodness of a hemisphere so free,
that the civilized would might be virtually one. So I began life, with a
[propagande?] in favour of Unity & against all that is selfish in
Nationality, as knowing that to hate & hurt neighbours is to hate & hurt
oneself,--and so I hope to end it, after this immediate pressure of
war-necessity is over. {u}Ultimately{/u}, I am sure of Union by Freedom:
{u}How{/u} & {u}when{/u}, I cannot see. … The {u}negroes{/u} are
free:--virtually so, as I trust, & {u}we{/u} are {u}more{/u} free than I
ever before remember.”
