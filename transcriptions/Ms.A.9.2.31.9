MWC to Anne Greene Chapman (address in London)

Long letter about War, Garrison’s position, etc.

“If this was only a single warfare,--a battle in the open field,--all
would be speedily settled. But it is of necessity slow, because they
that are summoned to fight it are at war in their own minds. They who
have renounced slavery in their own hearts, have yet a pride in not
acknowledging that this is a revolution, & cry ‘the Union & Constitution
as they were in 1860.’ This makes the U. S. appear scarcely better to
the world at large than the Rebels. Statesmen know better, for they
notice such things as abolition in the D.C. & Terr[itor]ies. But these
outward & visible signs are not needed by Philosophers. {u}They{/u} see
in the {u}conflict{/u} the assurance of victory, & they know the
{u}signs{/u} are sure to follow. It is most painful, certainly, to think
how {u}much{/u} blood must be shed while people are getting their eyes
open & learning their lesson. … I am daily engaged in observing the
workings of a political selfishness which would make of the world a
stage for the play of infernal passions, instead of the scene of good
will it might be. ‘Down with this or that nation!’ says one. ‘It is an
aristocratic, vile combination against human rights:--a privileged class
legislates in its own behalf’:--& he turns to carry on at home a work of
political ‘[truck? Trick?] & [Dicker?].’ by which he, having a rare acre
of porcelain clay, or an iron region, or money enough to set up the
Pemberton Cotton Mills company, may be by {u}law privileged{/u} to make
his Trillions out of the people at large. This was not seen behind the
blackness of slavery. But now it is seen; & it makes a part of the rage
of the time … one of the evil consequences of slavery … will exist in
the taxation, better borne because of the ignorant patriotism of which
the rich will take advantage; as they now do, only with a better chance,
to make themselves richer by making their neighbors poorer;--& create a
class of privileged ones, while exclaiming against the oppressions of
Europe. Now we {u}ought{/u} to be leading the way to a better state of
things. Instead of which, we are retrograding while the world is
advancing. They are bent on {u}shedding{/u} a burden which we are
creating. … All this reasoning & feeling sprung up in my mind on hearing
a pro-slavery patriot rail against Europe. He foamed with hate: but not
worse than I have heard Anti-Slavery patriots do. ‘It is no part of my
mission to defend Duchesses’—I always reply to these sorts of persons,
who always begin with a sling at the English nobility with whom they
imagine me to be so much identified in feeling that I shall of course
stand up for privileged classes: on the contrary, I have a testimony to
bear against {u}all{/u} class legislation, {u}every{/u} where. We must
try to find out what is good for the {u}whole world{/u}, & do it. We
must not look, every man on the things of himself, but also on the
things of another: & let alone Duchesses. I ask an anti-slavery patriot
if he does not feel his moral kindred with the Lancashire & other cotton
workers who are all this time distressed for food enough to keep soul &
body together; yet waiting, consoled in the suffering, while our War
with the slave power—our conflict with the wrong that endangers the
world’s peace, is being carried slowly on, to its triumph. They
{u}might{/u} compel ministers to acts of bad foreign policy, to obtain
temporary relief. ‘Madness!’ is the American patriot’s reply: True: then
why need the American patriot fulfil Jeff. Davis’s wishes & play into
the hands of the Times, by affirming with insulting taunts that Ministry
& people, with only some four or five exceptions in the whole nation,
are bent on that very madness which ministry & people agree in keeping
free from. … Garrison is shining at this hour, in contrast with
Pillsbury & Co. They mean well but they are like the Doctors who having
no remedies but irritants, exhibit them on all occasions, for the sake
of doing {u}something{/u} & building up {u}themselves{/u}.”
