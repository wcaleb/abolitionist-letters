Credits the English middle classes for preventing English intervention
in the Civil War. … “My admiration of the American people has been
greatly exalted by the events of the war, & there is no people whose
prosperity I regard as so essential to the happiness & civilization of
mankind. I am more of a republican than ever, & I have less & less hope
for the poor of Europe so long as they remain the victims & playthings
of monarchical & aristocratic constitutions & feudal traditions. I have
never been in a public meeting on which the American question was
described or explained, in which the great majority was not
unmistakeably on the Northern side. … In all I have said I don’t know
whether I appear as an apologist or a defender of England, but this I do
know that I am more zealous for you than for her.”
