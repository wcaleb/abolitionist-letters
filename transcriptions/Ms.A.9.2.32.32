Mary Estlin to [Caroline Weston]

“I live with you far more than in my own town or country. I rejoice with
you over every victory in the field or in the Senate. This passing of
the abolition ‘amendment’ thro’ the H. of Representatives seems the
crowning joy. How I rejoiced over it when it appeared in a daily paper’s
summary of news, & yet could meet no one who knew or cared at all about
it, or saw its importance till the ‘Liberator’ has come to confirm my
faith. … The wish to visit America has come on again with re-doubled
vehemence this year since all these cheering events have filled my
heart. Oh! that bodies were as fleet & moveable as thought & love!”
