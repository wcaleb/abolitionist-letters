RDW to [Caroline Weston?] {Some in {u}BAA{/u}.}

BAA: “After all it remains a fact that the bulk of the English working
classes and the great majority of the most eminent Englishmen—men of
real not conventional eminence—have been all along on your side—and I
think much of the unfriendly feeling here which from ignorance, with the
exception of the aristocratic & clerical parties who have felt that the
success of a great Republic was dangerous to the permanence of their own
parties. … Cairnes came into my office yesterday in a most unusual fever
of excitement & exaltation at the fall of Richmond.” After the passage
in BAA and some personal news: “… Even as matters stand the work of
reconstruction will be a very difficult one—and much will depend on the
Slaveholding class being effectually deprived of any opportunity of
doing mischief in future. I have great sympathy with Wendell Phillips in
his views about Louisiana, but I think him far from judicious in being
so ready to quarrel with all England on account of the conduct of the
upper classes in this country. …”
