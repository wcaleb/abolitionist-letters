“… I expect that in a very few years the English people will be
unwilling to admit that so large a proportion of their aristocracy &
ruling classes sympathized with the South. Class interests,
anti-republican prejudices & the fear of your rapidly mounting power
afford the explanation. For myself I was never so much of a republican
as now, for I am persuaded that no other nation would have acted, so
bravely, so ably, so effectively & with so much humanity & magnanimity
under similar circumstances.” He regrets the split in the ranks. …
“Slavery is not dead yet & so long as the colored people are excluded
from political power its influence for evil if not so great will be
almost as obstructive as ever. The efforts of abolitionists should not
be relaxed & I fear the apparent withdrawal of so many of the ablest
veterans of the cause will be regarded as if there was nothing more to
fight for. You know better than I do, but it is thus it seems to me.”
