RDW to [MWC?]. Villards in Europe; Franco-Prussian War; communism.

“What you say of the communistic spirit reminds me of the gloomy
forebodings of a longheaded & deepthinking friend of mine who called on
me in my son’s office a few days ago. He thinks the time will come
before very long when the people employed by others of all classes,
animated by the spirit you speak of, will rise up & claim an even share
in the property of all who have any, & that nobody will in future be
allowed to accumulate for himself only. … I prefer to let the world wag
on, in the confidence that things in general are likely to go on in the
future pretty much as they have done heretofore, & that it will be a
long time before the majority of the owners of property the wide world
over give in to the theories of the workmen in the cities. … During the
Franco-German war I felt great sympathy for the innocent sufferers from
the calamities of war, & was actively employed in the efforts that were
made to relieve them—but my sympathy was for the people & not for the
rulers, & for the ruling classes in France I have a feeling of dislike &
indignation on account of their apparent assumption of property in
Italy, which they evidently wish to keep divided for the purpose of
their own national ambition & think [for?] a meddling ascendancy. Caring
nothing themselves for the Pope or his Religion, they would like to make
use of both as [means?] of keeping open Italy’s wounds. As far as I see
it does not seem to be the object of any party in France to remove the
plague of ignorance & petty vanity which more than anything else is the
cause of the internal weakness of France.”
