Stephens, M., to Mary A. Estlin; Lands End, England. To be away from
Bristol is to be away from Anti-Slavery action and interest. Reflects on

place in America. Has met some who were acquainted with “{u}every{/u}
thing that is going on in the world {u}but{/u} slavery. Yet that is the
greatest evil in the world.”
