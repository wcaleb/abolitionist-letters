MWC to Elizabeth Bates Chapman

Talks about the marvelous change in the fact that so many people she
meets say “Oh—you were right & we were wrong. … But it is not uncommon
to hear from abolitionists, what, tho’ a truth is an unbecoming taunt
under the circumstances—‘{u}We told you so!{/u}’ [p] And some of our
abolitionists talks by weeks together in public lectures, of carrying
our republican institutions through Europe by fire & sword, saying at
the same time they are not worth the carrying, because we have never
known & may not hope to know a congress that could not be bought for
20,000,000 & that are people are merely moved by necessity to
emancipate. … All this is ill-judged.” She is probably referring to the
Phillips and Pillsbury crowd.
