Emma Michell to Anne Weston; Bristol

Spiritual bond connecting all abolitionists. Water cure. Addresses AWW
as “Annie” because she feels so familiar. “Are not abolitionists all
brethren? And there are no Misses or Masters among them, either with the
seen or unseen,--they are truly a household band though scattered far
and wide, though never to be united in this world, they will be united
together one family in Heaven. …” Says Mary Estlin is probably going to
Birmingham to “try the effect of the Water Cure which Mr. Estlin thinks
may in some respects be favorable for her.” Michell thinks she has been
overworked, never stops to eat, etc. So hydropathy will be good partly
for regular meals and rest. “The medical men who have seen her hitherto
all have said that they can detect no reason why she should not [be
strengthened], but she has so long accustomed herself to this diet [of
bread and biscuits], that she will find some difficulty in altering it.
One great advantage of her going will be the breaking through old habits
of this kind, and in fact of taking her out of her own hands.”
