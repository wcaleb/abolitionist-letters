Thanks her for the invitation she extended to Sumner, which he passed
on. “Our election you’ll read at length about in the Lib[erato]r. I need
not enlarge here. Read Dexter’s Speech, one of the most conservative
lawyers retired now in wealthy seclusion & see how exactly his picture
of the crisis agrees with that of the Garrisonians. [p] We hoped some
from the {u}reaction{/u} if Buchanan were elected & when he crushes
Kansas, steals Cuba, divides Texas into four States &c &c sets up again
the slave trade such reaction may come. But all seems now settling down
into the old indifference. If Sumner’s outrage & Kansas did not rouse
them, what can we expect will have that effect?”
