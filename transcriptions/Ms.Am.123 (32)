“Your pamphlets have never reached me on the Chartist question, but the
letter & papers sent with your letter did & they were amply sufficient
for my purpose. Thank you a thousand times for them. I send with this
two of the notices of my lecture (Ann says from vanity) I say from
desire you should see how great the pigmy looked when seated on the
giant shoulders of your assistance. If you think it would please him
will you direct a copy of each to Ashurst whose letter was a great help
to me. The subject excited great attention & interest. I have repeated
it several times in different towns. The report in the Tribune omits my
statistics & names. ... My lecture on Chartism took so much that I think
I shall write one on {u}British India{/u} that subject is attracting
great attention here. I am only afraid that it would lead me so
decidedly to Anti Slavery ground that the mixed audience of our Lyceums
though they expect some Anti Sly from me & will bear considerable, wd
not quite tolerate it that would oblige me to make a tame lecture which
I should not do even for the sake of introducing a favorite topic. ... I
shall send you if I can find it {u}Mann{/u}’s 4^th^ July oration on the
state of this country – tis glorious.
