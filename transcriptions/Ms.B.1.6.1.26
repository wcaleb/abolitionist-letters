[p. 23:] “There is a class of people in the community who, conscious of
their inability to make it appear that the noble and truly holy event
which we commemorate to-day has been anything than a most successful
experiment, are constantly endeavoring to obscure the greatness of the
event by casting doubt & suspicion on the {u}motive{/u}, which led the
British Government to abolish Slavery in their W. India possessions.
They deny that even any {u}leaven{/u} of benevolence or philanthropy
entered into those motives. They assert that this act of the British
Government grew out of motives of ambition, cupidity, or worldly policy
in some other shape; motives of which kind they affirm to be the sole
ones from which a British Government is capable of acting. They point us
to the China Opium War, to the subjugation of millions of Asiatics to
the British Empire, & to the Affghanistan War now waging in the heart of
India. They take us to the ‘fast-anchored isle’ itself, and point us to
the miserable, half-starved operatives of British manufacturing towns,
to the ‘Colliery Serfs,’ and in general to the bread-taxed laborers and
yeomanry of what was once ‘Merry England,’ but such no more. A sad
picture it is enough, as every one must allow. England is unquestionably
guilty of great oppression and most cruel injustice, both to her own
population, and to the people of other & heathen lands. What then? Does
this truth destroy the value of the West India experiment? Is it any
warrant why Americans should close their eyes & their ears to the
results of that experiment, & refuse to be influenced by the great &
deeply interesting facts which have attended that experiment? Not so. I
distrust – I must acknowledge it – I distrust the honesty of those men,
(& editors,) who are so sedulously endeavoring to take away from Great
Britain all claims to respect & gratitude for W.I. Emancipation. I
distrust their love of liberty, when I see them so eager to divert
attention from this event, fruitful as it is in instruction & warning to
our own land, and so clamorous to keep the public eye fixed only on the
injuries & crimes of the British Government. I distrust their
{u}honesty{/u}, because, while I hear their incessant noise concerning
British outrages, I hear never a word from them in rebuke of the
despotic and oppressive conduct of our own National Government. ... Oh
no! they can see the hypocrisy of a Foreign Government, which makes no
pretensions to the free & equal birth & rights of all men, and can
inveigh against it (I say again) with most pious virtuous horror; but
their eyes are blinded to the greater hypocrisy and the more iniquitous
& disgraceful oppression of our own land. ... I stand not here in any
wise to excuse, much less defend the doings of the British
{u}Government{/u}. I stand not here even to claim for them the
{u}smallest{/u} share of credit or honor for West India Emancipation. I
suppose, however, that in whatever is honorable to mankind, the Br.
{u}Govt.{/u} will sustain no disadvantageous comparison with t.
{u}Govt{/u}. of any other civilized & professedly Christian land; and
this, after all, is saying but little. But on this question, of honor or
credit for the hitherto unknown deed of giving liberty, at a great cost,
to 800,000 slaves, I would say a few words; for it appears to me [that]
there is a great deal of unnecessary ignorance on this very simple and
intelligible subject. The credit of giving liberty to these slaves
belongs, not to the Br. Govt., as I understand it, but to the British
{u}people{/u}; -- a distinction (between the Br. Govt. & People) which
ought to be kept in mind. ... How was Emancipation in the Br. W. I.
possessions brought about? It was no self-originated act of the Br.
Government. Men & women of living consciences, of human sympathies, of a
Christian sense of duty, brought the subject of Br. W. I. {u}Slavery{/u}
before the British {u}people{/u}, and they kept it before them. By the
press, and from the pulpit, they disseminated light & knowledge, on the
subject, thought t. land; persevering in the work, through evil report &
obloquy & calumny & every shape of hostility to their cause, until in
God’s good providence they reached the happy days of {u}good{/u} report,
and general encouragement, and final success. [etc.] ...And for the
example they nobly have placed before the world of {u}justice{/u},
though tardy, for t. evidence they have been t. means of giving of t.
temporal blessings which follow upon righteousness, they will never
cease to merit the respect & gratitude of every true man, patriot, and
Christian. ... Does not an event like this well deserve, does it not
most emphatically {u}claim{/u}, commemoration of Americans? On other
occasions, when t. voice of Liberty, either triumphant or struggling
against t. power of despots, has reached our shores, we have deemed it
incumbent on us, as lovers of freedom to echo t. call, and to send back
an answering voice wh. shd. cheer t. hearts of t. free, and startle t.
dull & heavy ear of t. tyrant. When Greece, when Poland, when t. So.
American republics, raised t. cry for sympathy & help, our citizens
deemed themselves both bound & privilege to respond by word & deed.
[Surely we should congratulate England, etc.] ...”

JAC to HCW; n.p. Invitation to anti-slavery meeting. Talks about his
opposition to the organized church.

“Had a long letter from R.D. Webb of Dublin recently. A part of it was
evidently designed for your eye, as it was an answer to your “{u}good
long letter about a ‘World’s Convention{/u}.” When you come to the
meeting you shall see it. “Thinks it is not time for such a step –
‘Twould not be a World’s convention, but a convention of a few Old
Organized abolitionists from Gr Brn. & America. Our principles should be
made acquainted with different parts of the globe” &c &c. These are some
of the views expressed by Dick Webb. He makes a thousand and one
apologies for not writing you directly.”
