RDW to EQ. Has corresponded with H. Martineau on Irish political
situation. ... Sends a Dublin Freemans Journal containing J. Haughton’s
letter to O’Connell on Rogers’ {u}Debasing Effects of Superstition{/u},
and comments on quarrel. Describes O’Connell’s apology to Garrison. Has
received letters from the Howitts but fears they aren’t suitable for the
Liberty Bell.

“I also with the valor of a hen providing for her starving chickens,
wrote to Harriet Martineau, venturing at the same time to give her a
piece of my mind upon the present position of Ireland considered
politically. I condemned the bullying [?] attitude of the government and
confessed to a sympathy for O’Connell under present circumstances,
though by no means an unqualified admirer of him in general, or at all.
Well, my dear, she sent me such a tirade against him for his badness,
guilt, and basenesss – and such a eulogy of the dignified, wise & humane
conduct of the Tory Ministry with all their horse, foot & artillery, as
amazed poor me and all belonging to me. James Haughton was shocked, my
wife astonished (she is more of a repealer & an O’Connellite than I am)
Richard Allen said oh my! & dear me! and in spite of Harriet’s
declaration in this very letter that she is a staunch liberal – there is
a decided disposition evinced by the Dublin Clique to set her down as a
double dyed Orangewoman or Conservative which last is a little less
ferocious but not much better. [p] In my reply (for I replied) I
reminded her that whatever O’Connell’s guilt might be for exasperating
the Irish against the English this guilt was equalled by the government
press of England which is full of contemptuous & bitter language against
Catholic Ireland and that all our rulers – the late Whigs and the
present Tories are steeped to the lips in the guilt of the blood,
devastation, & robbery of the Afghans & Chinese – so that unless she
limits her ideas of moral duty (as I think it likely enough she does)
within European or {u}Christian{/u} boundaries (as most
{u}Christians{/u} do) they are one and all more guilty, base and bad
than O’Connell who in stirring up a [?] support for his purposes of
political hatred against his opponents does no more than is reasonably
allowed by party morality to every party man. The English are so
accustomed to hear of rapine and bloodshed in India that they really
dont seem to think the worse of any who take part in it, either as tools
or as instigators – and I have no doubt Harriet Martineau looks on Lord
Morpeth, Sir R. Peel, Sir J. Graham, Lord Melbourne & others as models
of uprightness, integrity, honor, & good feeling. Which I dont. So long
as principles of political expediency are allowed to be pleaded in
excuse of participation in such atrocities as were enacted in the East
by the English within the last two years, character is a sham & humanity
a bye word. All these men were members of the cabinets by whom these
wars were sanctioned, commenced & cruelly concluded. No commercial
treaties, no subsequent advantages arising from the Chinese Invasion
will ever I hope reconcile men to that cruel, mean, & ruffianly act of
national brigandage or to the men who when in power gave it their
sanction & support. It makes me loathe them to think of it and the
[canting?], and avaricious people who suffered such deeds to be enacted
in their name. Nothing ever revealed to me with such sickening reality
the hollowness & emptiness of the national religion, the gossamer
thinness of the film of civilization which covers our real barbarism,
hard heartedness & cruelty. All our sects & professors with very slight
exception acted in respect to their wars much as they would have done in
America with respect to the Divine Institution of the Cowhide & the
Paddle. ... [pp] I send thee by this post a Dublin Freemans Journal of
Oct. 31 – it is full of interest. There is a letter from James Haughton
to O’Connell animadverting on Rogers ‘Debasing Effects of Superstition’
-- & defending W.L.G. from the imputation of having written that very
discreditable production. ... I have heard nothing but reprobation of
that article -- & I never saw any thing of Rogers’s that I could not
appreciate & comprehend but this one. It seems to me a very sorrowful
invasion of private life & that forbearance and courtesy we owe to one
another round the social board which should never be dragged before the
public on any pretence. No doubt if Rogers could have seen as in a
mirror all his own devotional faces or grimaces for the last 4 or 5
years only, he could & probably would write abundantly about the
Debasing effects of superstition which they exemplify. Thou knows that I
am by no means an O’Connellite: nevertheless whatever he be, he is the
man who above all eminent public men (not precisely identified as a
professional abolitionist, like George Thompson & Joseph Sturge, with
the Anti Slavery cause) who has done the most valiantly for the Slave.
He has always been ready to lend his powerful aid in Parliament, in
Conventions & in Public Meetings to the Slave’s cause. He has been
affable and accessible to a degree most unusual to public men in these
countries, and when as I compare all this with the indifference or
hostility of almost all others who fill the public eye, there is much
credit due to his labours & his sincerity in this behalf. ... O’Connells
character should be sacred from merely personal attacks --- with all
abolitionists, so long as he is faithful to the A. Slavery cause. If the
faces we make are to subject us to newspaper animadversion, what is to
become of any of us, particularly the ugly fellows? To think of Rogers
remembering three years back that O’Connell looked like a calf merely
because he put on {u}a pious face{/u} is really too bad. All we who look
prim and put on [gallery?] grimaces are safe no longer. ... [Discusses
the opening of O’Connell’s trial.] ... Government are fortifying all the
barracks & military positions in Ireland – Dublin & the whole country is
bristling with bayonets. It is in face {u}occupied by military{/u} – and
if it be a paternal act for fathers to show all their teeth to their
offspring then indeed are our rulers most paternal or as Harriet
Martineau, in her letter to me, styles them “dignified, wise & humane.”
The people have been and are likely to be perfectly peaceable – every
effort is made by their leaders to keep them so – but the repeal
agitation is nearer their hearts than ever. And some recent adhesions to
it are very important. I think little of the wisdom, expediency or
practicability of O’Connells measure of repeal – but the people are of a
different way of thinking and nothing that government has said or done
is calculated to alter their minds. Our Government have no notion of
doing anything in Ireland but by force if “they can possibly avoid it. I
go the whole hog with Rogers in my hatred of the spirit of governments.”
