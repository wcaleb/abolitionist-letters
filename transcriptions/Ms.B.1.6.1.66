**[1846, 02?-24] Ms.B.1.6.1.66**

Copied extracts from letters from MWC to RDW, apparently forwarded to
May Jr., in unknown hand.

June 29, 1845: “I wish you would feel a call to do one thing—to warn
Douglass of the ill effect it has on a man’s respectability to aim at
anything for himself in the prosecution of a philanthropic enterprise x
x x Douglass has done right hitherto; pray strengthen him with the
example of Garrison, Phillips & Quincy, who have been a thousand times
offered all the kingdoms of popularity & solid pudding to boot, if they
would but compromise—chose to cleave to the Am. A. S. Society, and to
suffer persecution with the people of God x x x The cause has been
nothing but good to Douglass, in a worldly point of view; I hope he will
be strong enough to endure it when the endurance shall seem to threaten
him with loss. He has uncommon abilities of a practical & useful sort; I
earnestly hope he may not yield to temptation.”

Jan. 23, 1846: “If Douglass can but keep from the temptation to ‘get
into his own head,’ (as we call being drunk with vanity) because of the
general attention that his powers, circumstances and cause excite when
united, he will not only do the cause great good, but receive & deserve
a high place in the list of public benefactors. If his good sense
prevail, all will go well.”

Feb 24, 1846: “Buffum tells me that Douglass is displeased at an
intimation in a letter of mine to you, that he would be tempted by
offers from the London Committee, to desert the Am. Society,--or to this
effect. It was not in my heart, at the time, as I recollect, to think
that he would {u}yield{/u}, & the very Saviour of men was tempted; so
that I don’t feel as if I had done Friend Douglass any wrong. If I had
thought he would yield, I would not have given him a letter of
introduction to any friend in England. ‘I am jealous over you with a
godly jealousy’ was it Paul who said? x x x My wish was, by stating just
what seemed to me the danger of the case,--that his great abilities, his
circumstances and inexperience, together with his characteristic
peculiarities, might put him in the way of temptation, from the London
Committee—to afford you the knowledge in which to act for his help.”
