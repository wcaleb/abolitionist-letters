May Jr., Notes of a Leicester Anti-Slavery Association meeting. 52pp.

A “Rev. Mr. Mason” rose to speak in favor of antislavery Constitution
and charged “his opponents with ‘backing out,’ and threw out sundry
sneers about {u}Non-resistance{/u} and {u}come-outerism{/u}, and to tell
how those, who took the side of the question which I have maintained,
sat still in this A. S. warfare, and ‘sucked their thumbs.’”
