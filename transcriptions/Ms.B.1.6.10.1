May Jr. to RDW {Some in {u}BAA{/u}}. Discusses Thompson in US. Regrets
the withdrawal of NASS subscriptions in Britain, but is glad there are
still “20 good ‘Standard’ subscribers” in the United Kingdom.

“What you said of Kagosima, & of the spirit which led to that wholesale
terrible destruction, is what impressed me so deeply … It takes {u}a
man{/u}, to think, to feel, to judge, & to speak, as you do in that
brief note. For God’s sake, speak out your censure of England, & of
every other Nation, which does such high-handed wickedness. Spare them
not. These faithful rebukes and testimonies are needed to save the
nation and the world.”
