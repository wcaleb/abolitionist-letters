Re: McClellan and Lincoln. “As for AL & Mac I’d cut off both hands
before unnecessarily doing anything to elect Mac, & one hand before
doing the same for Lincoln. Soon I shall find occasion to say why I
still remain reformer & not politician, still (as since 1843) prefer
justice to the Union, & still trust the old Anti Slavery policy that
it’s always safe to do right, deeply regretting that some of you cannot
any longer dare to stand on the old platform.”
