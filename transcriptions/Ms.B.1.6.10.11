May Jr. to Phillips

Re: McClellan and Lincoln. May believes Phillips is wrong about
McClellan. “Even you admit a great difference between Lincoln and
McClellan, a ~~great~~ choice between them ~~on political grounds~~,
when you say you would cut off {u}both hands{/u} before ‘doing anything
unnecessarily’ to elect McC. And {u}one{/u}, before doing the same for
L. I consider that I have done no otherwise than this {u}in kind{/u};
only that, {u}in degree{/u}, I think the difference between the two men
very much greater than you do. … You say {u}you{/u} still prefer to be a
reformer to a politician! That quite puzzles me. ~~I know not how to be
the latter~~. Am I the politician? That seems to much of a joke. I have
attended no polit. Convention, as a member of it (not even as a
spectator), have written no letters suggesting political nominations,
~~have sought the elevation of no particular man (except as aforesaid,
in expressing my conviction of the preference between men),~~ have
neither spoken in public, nor labored in private, to set up a different
candidate from him whom the great body of loyal men had indicated on
Anti Slavery grounds; and so (pardon me) don’t see why {u}you{/u} should
intimate that {u}I{/u} have ceased to stand on the old A. S. platform,
while you have strictly kept there.”
