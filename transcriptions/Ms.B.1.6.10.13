May Jr. to RDW {some in {u}BAA{/u}}

Just before the passage in book, May is talking about his reduced
correspondence. “I write to no one {u}abroad{/u} as frequently as I did.
You know how …” After the passage: “I hate to write {u}much{/u} to
Englishmen in this seeming censorious and complaining way, but in
honesty I must sometimes tell what I do so deeply feel. I have been
restrained too, I frankly say, very often, by the slow developement
[sic] of our own National purpose in regard to Slavery. … Yet, I
{u}never{/u} doubted {u}with which party{/u} (i.e. North or South)
{u}were all the Anti Slavery integrity, purpose, & noble character{/u}
of this land; nor, any more, {u}where the Anti Slavery of Europe ought
to be{/u}. … even your own self, for a long time, did not (as I thought)
understand me, or our country. For more than 20 years I was not backward
to testify against the corruptions, the sins, the oppressions, the more
culpable than pagan idolatry of my country. I would not stand with her
in the wrong. But must I continue to censure, and protest, and keep
aloof, when she arrests her steps, stops to survey her ground, begins to
see the wrong of her past course, begins to comprehend the true
character of her Southern associates and the only object of their past
union with the North, begins at length to re-trace her steps, sets her
face in the right direction, and strikes Slavery telling blows, which
soon multiply rapidly and at length culminate in the determination to
destroy it utterly, root and branch. Shall I not stand {u}for{/u}, and
{u}with{/u}, my country, when she is right? Yes, all the more will I,
and may I, {u}and must I{/u}, because I did not fail to rebuke her, when
she was false to both God and man. I will not be, I cannot be, a
mal-content, though some among us are so (with a deal of {u}cant{/u}, I
think), when the Nation, its Government and its People, are making such
wonderful strides towards Justice, Liberty, and Redemption.” Other parts
of the letter, written on another day, castigate Wendell Phillips for
trying to divide the Republicans, “the {u}only{/u} Anti Slavery
political party of the North.” May, on the other hand, believed that on
purely antislavery grounds, Lincoln would be better than Fremont. Says
Garrison is sometimes too sharp in his criticisms of Daniel Ricketson
and Prof. Newman.
