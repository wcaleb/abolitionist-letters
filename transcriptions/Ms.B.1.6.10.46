May Jr. to RDW. Although “it is true we write much seldomer than
formerly,” his heart will never forget those in Britain who have been
such steadfast sympathizers. “We differed much, you and I, during the
war, as we both know.” Estlin and Wigham also seemed to doubt the AASS
course. “Well! We differed in opinion. But I, for one, never was
alienated or sundered from any of you. {u}I knew{/u} that you had much
ground for your doubt & fear. … I lamented it, as you know, I wondered
at it; I still wonder at it:--because, as I saw, & you saw, there sprang
up at once those who {u}did{/u} see it, did take their position at once,
& never wavered. Such were Gasparin & others on the Continent, such were
G. Thompson, Forster, Thos. Hughes, Baptist Noel, Newman, Newman Hall,
Bright, Mill, and many more; and if these were so clear, I asked myself,
why should not the Abolitionists of Gr. Britain be equally so?” His time
has been consumed by the Testimonial for Garrison. “I could not write,
perhaps, without some allusion to it, & might seem to be asking
contributions from abroad, which we felt we had no right (in a sense) to
do, however appropriate to do so, on general grounds. But we had decided
to propose a {u}National{/u} Testimonial, and so that the co-operation
of persons in other countries, if it came at all, should be absolutely
unsolicited. And so it has been.” Thinks Johnson should be impeached.
