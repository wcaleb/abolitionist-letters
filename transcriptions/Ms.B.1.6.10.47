May Jr. to RDW.

“You learn from the ‘Nation,’ & otherwise, how our little National
family is getting along. I trust you see how completely Andrew Johnson
is foiled, defeated, check-mated, {u}and{/u} despised. … And we should
not have had Negro Suffrage throughout the Rebel States, had not A. J.’s
policy proved the absolute necessity of it. National counsels, I
believe, never rise to a high moral plane; and I am sure our National
Govt. deserves small respect or credit for acting from a sense of
justice, or high regard to the rights of the weak.” Talks about
Garrison’s plans for his Europe trip and the Paris Antislavery Congress.
“Early in December I had the great pleasure of listening to a lecture,
in Boston, from Henry Vincent. It was upon this country, & the mutual
relations of Gr. Britain & the U.S., and was full of thought, & happy
ideas, & sensible suggestions, poured out in such an uninterrupted flow
of language as I have seldom listened to. … His lectures must have a
great effect in promoting a good understanding between the two countries
by showing how deep, & strong, & wide spread among the working & middle
classes of England is the friendship for this country.” After the
lecture, Thompson introduced May to Vincent.
