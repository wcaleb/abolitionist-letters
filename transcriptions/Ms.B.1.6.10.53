May Jr. to RDW

He apologizes that he has been a poor correspondent for the last several
years. He has had so much writing to do that he has tended to restrict
his writing to absolute necessity. “Surely, if I could have made any
exception, it wd have been in the case of Mary Estlin and yourself;--to
both of whom I feel so largely indebted, not for letters merely, but for
such years of faithful friendship & co-operation, as are rare in this
world’s experiences.” Hopes he is determined to come to the US. Laments
the division in the antislavery ranks as “{u}a dishonor{/u}, resting on
us all, whether we are or are not, personally responsible for its
existence.”
