May Jr. to RDW.

“One week from yesterday Genl. Grant is to be inaugurated President of
these United States,--not as ‘united’ as we could wish, but with a
pretty strong determination in them, having up-rooted slavery therein,
to allow none of its off-shoots, nor any other evil thing, to
{u}destroy{/u} the {u}Union{/u}. I am feeling very great confidence
that, under Grant’s administration, the uniting influences will be
powerfully strengthened … I {u}expect{/u} very great things of Grant.”
