May Jr. to RDW.

Sarah Pugh “is very full of the Woman Suffrage Movement, and
particularly desirous to bring the Lucy Stone wing of that movement into
harmony & active cooperation with the Mrs. Stanton & Susan B. Anthony
wing. I don’t believe that will be accomplished by any
manipulation;--but I think it highly probable that all public criticism
of each other will cease; and in course of time, perhaps, they will
occasionally unite in public meetings. But there is a clear difference
in their aims & methods. Lucy Stone relies mainly upon what we may call
the old Anti Slavery methods,--argument, appeal, persistent agitation,
the essential justice & right of the cause. Mrs. Stanton, & Miss
Anthony—particularly the latter—are for gaining their end, any way; and
so court politicians, & political parties, no matter how hollow &
intriguing … I am greatly obliged to you for the little volume of
Cavour’s on Ireland. I have dipped into it, but not as yet given it a
careful reading, as ‘tis my intent to do. The Latin races never seem to
have thought the races of Northern Europe worth much consideration or
study; so there seems something really original & surprising that an
Italian shd have made this special study of Ireland & her people. There
appears to be some new political phase about to develop itself in the
Irish in this country. They are largely (it is said) quitting the
Democratic party, which has befooled them from the first, and inclining
to the Republican ranks. I rather dread their becoming a power there.
Certain Republicans, chiefly of the middle & western States, would be
very willing to make use of the Irish hatred of England, to stir up bad
blood, even to a war, provided it would carry {u}them{/u} into power and
profit. We shall be able to check-mate that infamous game, I think.” But
England must compensate for damages to Alabama.
