More laments about European opinion on the North, particularly
disappointment with Professor Newman’s recent turn. “I think the
Administration of Mr. Lincoln may stand a comparison, not merely with
any preceding American administration, but with any government of any
nation of Europe, past or present, as to the general spirit of its acts
or as to their details, even to the smallest.” Defends Lincoln’s course
by saying that if he had moved too abruptly, “it would have alarmed &
excited a large body of the people, who never would have been persuaded
to lay a strong hand upon Slavery … Remember that it was not enough (as
in a monarchical govt.) that the Chief Magistrate and his Cabinet and
Advisers should be satisfied as to the justice or even need of a great
change of government policy,--not enough even that a majority of the
Representative legislative bodies should be so satisfied;--in a
government, like ours, it was necessary that its policy should be able
to meet … the most captious and plausible objections of its enemies,
without any needless risk of being set aside. … Nevertheless, in spite
of all criticism [of Lincoln], impatient or hostile, there stands {u}the
Record{/u}, such a record of progressive steps, of the most
comprehensive, thorough, & vital nature in three years, as no Nation
known to History, it may safely be said, ever made in a like space.”
