May Jr. to RDW.

Has read about the disgraceful treatment of Fenian prisoners. “That is a
villainous trait in England too,--the way it (i.e. its Govt. & leading,
governing classes, whoever they are) stands by its servants through
thick & thin, no matter how bad they behave. England is a dishonoured
land, today, for letting off Eyre, Gov. of Jamaica … And now will she
hold a strict, just hand, with those jail governors who so tortured the
Fenian prisoners? Small sympathy have I with that blundering, stupid,
absurd Fenian *Movement;* yet, much with the deep-seated feeling, in
their inmost being, of the contemptuous, insulting, oppressive treatment
which England had dealt out to them and their fathers and Ireland so
long.”

RDW to [?]. Ireland better in Union with England than alone; talks about
Irish politics, American poetry, etc.

“The general feeling in England is that Ireland is essential to the
safety & greatness of England, & the English are determined to keep us
while they probably have little love for us. As an Irishman I
reciprocate this state of feeling exactly. Ireland is in my opinion in
every way better in union with England than she could be alone. Ireland
was never so rich, so prosperous, so well cultivated, so well governed,
so well off in every respect as she is at present, at any former time.
But between the priests until lately, & the Fenian sympathizers at
present, the ignorant impulsive peasants & lower middle class of
Catholics are kept with their eyes continually looking backwards to the
unquestionably evil times behind the last 50 years when the government
of the country by England was utterly bad & utterly selfish. Indeed I
think the English as a nation quite as selfish & insolent as any other.
But taking us Irish as we are if left alone we wd be like so many
[illegible.] We are a nation of bigots, Catholic & Protestant much
alike. The proportion of really liberal, large minded patriots is
lamentably small.”
