Emilie A. Venturi to Karl Blind. Mazzini wanted her to ask him to send
occasional letters on German affairs that Mazzini could translate into
Italian. “He says certain German correspondences have been sent him,
which he has been unable to insert [in *Roma del Popolo*], on account of
their violent tone against the Slavonians & French; as he has been
equally unable to insert the French & Slavonian letters sent to him, on
account of their excessive violence against the Germans!”

RDW to McKim. “As to the Nation I praise it continually. If I had my
will, I wd, as a patriotic American & a sincere well wisher to my
country, constitute Mr. Godkin the Presidents Moral Adviser. With such a
counselor at his back & think vast results for good might be looked for
in the United States. [p] I never thought I was treated otherwise than
courteously by the Nation, in which I only appeared as the Champion of
Mrs Josephine Butler, one of the most admirable & gifted women in
England, who was treated some what cavalierly by the English
correspondent Mr Leslie Stephen, whose letters I nevertheless generally
read with entire approval. [p] I think the Nation the ablest paper I
read, & I take the London Spectator, the Manchester Examiner & Times,
the N. Y. Times, the Springfield Republican, the Golden Age, Boston
Advertiser, Athenaeum, &c. &c. … [Tell WPG that he hasn’t been able to
get subscribers for the Nation.] The truth is we are so taken up with
our own scurvy & silly political quarrels, we have no time to think of
anything else…”

May Jr. to RDW. He doesn’t think the Republicans’ revolt against Grant
will succeed, and adds some words of praise for what the President has
done. Says the *Nation* has been overly harsh, while the articles of
George William Curtis is perhaps not hard enough.
