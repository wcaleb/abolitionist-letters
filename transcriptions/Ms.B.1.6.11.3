May Jr. to RDW. 8pp. Webb should never doubt how highly May values his
letters. Full page about the weather. Reports that the “Prohibitionists”
and the “Labor Reform” party are both nominating Phillips for governor.
“A good & able Reformer, he has made very bad work of politics every
time he has essayed to deal in them. The holding of office, himself,
would be a very different thing from criticising others in office.”
Aaron Powell serves Phillips ably by giving him the *Standard*’s weekly
pages as a platform. “Our Labor Reform party is one of follies &
inconsistencies, and W. P. is {u}stirring them up{/u} to measures wholly
at variance with his earlier principles. Their leaders are nearly all a
set of idle & noisy men & women, whose maxims are of the most selfish &
monopolizing sort & undeserving of respect. [p] The War! It interests us
intensely,--it absorbs us almost as much as our own did. … We constantly
have the tidings, rumors, and news of the day before. The Democratic
party here gives its sympathy to Napoleon & the French. Nobody else
does. Not that we have any ill feeling to the French, whose nation has
been friendly to us up to the time of our late War,--when Napoleon
behaved worse to us, a great deal, than the British Govt. did, meanly
sending Maximilian & French troops to Mexico, to be in readiness to
interfere against us, & help the Slaveholders’ Rebellion. … Americans
generally desire the downfall of Napoleon, and the utter overthrow of
the Buonaparte family & influence;--certainly the former. And as they
believe the German character far better, far truer & trustier, far more
sensible & thoughtful, than the French, so they vastly prefer the
success of Germany—for the German peoples seem wonderfully united in
this resistance to Napoleon’s infamous assault upon them—in this
contest.”
