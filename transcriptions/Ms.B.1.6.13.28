May Jr., Notes re: annexation of Texas and England’s attitude re: Texas.

“Dr. Channing says – “To me it seems not only the t. right, but t. duty
of t. free States, in case of t. annexation of Texas, to say to t.
slaveholding states, we regard this act as t. dissolution of t. Union,”
&c. &c. (See also, even more emphatic, his 2d part of the “Duty of the
Free States,” p. 446, 2d book of my Eng. Ed. of Channing.) [next page]
{u}Argument or Syllogism{/u}: to prove that the protection and
{u}extension of slavery{/u} is the settled policy of this Government.
“The annexation of Texas is the settled policy of this Govt” – says Mr.
Holms of S.C. But, t. annexation of Texas is identical with
{u}protection{/u} to, and {u}extension of{/u}, {u}slavery{/u}.
{u}Ergo{/u}. Protection to, & Extn of Sl: is t. settled policy of this
Government. {u}q:e:d:{/u}” [back of notes] {u}Mr Nelson’s Speech{/u} ...
If {u}dissolved{/u}, Europe wd cry out & say, There was an end of Free
Govt! (No! indeed, then, under God, a {u}free{/u} govt wd {u}begin{/u}.)
