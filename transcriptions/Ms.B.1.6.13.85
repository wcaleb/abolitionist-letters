Regrets that abolitionists have sunk from level of “Universal Men” to
Americans.

“On the great topic of the day, the American Revolution of 1861, there
is a wide difference of opinion entertained between New & Old England.
Public opinion here I think decidedly recognizes the right of the
Southern States to choose their own form of Government. I have never yet
seen an argument against it worthy of notice except the statement that a
designing minority have produced the division, which all the facts that
have come under my notice repudiate & refute. The North has no more
right to control the South than Austria has to control Hungary, Russia
Poland, or England, Ireland. Government is a question that every
nation—i.e. every community of men containing within itself the elements
of self government—ought to be left to itself to settle. Any
interference from outsiders is to be condemned, and the slavery of the
South makes no difference in the right. It would have made no different
in my estimation even if the policy of the North had been to extinguish
slavery. There is no doubt that this would have made a great difference
in the sentiment of this country, but my own deliberate judgment is that
you in the North have no right to interfere by force of arms in the
government of the South. As it is the North is imply fighting for
Empire—the basest & most brutal tyranny that exists upon the earth is
attempting by force of arms to sustain {u}itself{/u} for there can be no
doubt that 34 states united to uphold African Slavery is a far more
powerful despotism than the Confederate States alone could be. It is
this feeling that separates the North from the sympathies of the world …
Of course with you the Union is an idea filling every Northern heart.
But it is an idol which I trust a merciful Providence is going to
destroy, and I believe that every American will be in a better state for
realizing the glorious destiny that yet awaits him when he regards the
Union from the same stand point that we look upon the revolted colonies
of 1776. [p] Of course you are far too proud a people to believe this
yet. A seven years war with all the sufferings it will entail on the
whole continent & the world at large will make you both a sadder & a
wiser people … I hold Military despotism to be the same everywhere, and
that is at present the character of government wherever your armies
coerce the people of the separate states. [p] I want the Abolitionists
of America to take a broader & wider & deeper view of this subject than
they have done. I loved them because I thought they were ‘{u}men{/u}’
not Americans or New Englanders, or Northerners, but rising above all
such distinctions were {u}Universal Men{/u}, and to my great grief, I
found they nearly all sunk from this sublime height to the level of
Americans.”
