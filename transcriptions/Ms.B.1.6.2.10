**[1845, 12-29] Ms.B.1.6.2.10**

May Jr. to JB Estlin. 12pp.

There have been rumors of war over Oregon. “Whether I am apathetic, or
what, I cannot say; but I never have been apprehensive of a war between
the U.S. and England. I cannot make it seem any other than a most
foolish & almost impossible thing. I know we have utterly unscrupulous
men at the nominal head of our national affairs. Would to God New
England was forever separated from all connexion with them! With the
Slaveholding States I mean. If we do not cut asunder the tie which binds
us, Slavery will be the millstone which will drag us to destruction. …”
But he doesn’t believe the South will actually risk a war, because “it
would be a signal for a general Slave-insurrection.” Praises Sumner’s
“True Grandeur of Nations” speech. Talks about fair donations. “Your
sympathy & help are everything to the cause; I speak now of the Br. and
Irish friends generally. My father asked me, ‘{u}On what terms{/u} do
these people abroad furnish all these beautiful & valuable articles to
your Fair, year after year?’ I smiled and told him there were {u}no
terms{/u}—that these things were a free gift … Even Judge Jay, by far
the strongest man who has acted with the ‘Liberty Party’ utterly rejects
their doctrine of the {u}Antislavery{/u} character of the Constitution,
and heartily adopts & advocates our position, that there is no hope for
the Slave save in the Dissolution of the Union. As to the matter of
voting or non-voting, I would refer you to an article in the ‘Liberator
of Nov. 7 1845’ headed {u}Disunion Ballots{/u}. This is all the voting,
it seems to me, which can be done by antislavery men, under our Const.”
