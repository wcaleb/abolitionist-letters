JB Estlin to May Jr.; Bristol {Some in {u}BAA{/u}.}

Regarding books; Douglass’s visit; criticism of HCW, etc.

He objects to a passage in the *Narrative* depicting the flogging of a
woman. Has invited Douglass to come stay in his house in Bristol and
Douglass has accepted. He likes Wright’s disunion pamphlet but not much
else about Wright. “His unmeasured abuse of a sabbath disgusts me.”
