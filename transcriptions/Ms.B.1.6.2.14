May Jr. to Estlin; Leicester

Various subjects, including Oregon dispute. Lengthy condemnation of the
Polk administration’s machinations to get Oregon. “This is the position
of the War question now. Peace is an unspeakable Blessing, and perhaps
can hardly be bought too dearly. But I do think that a price may be
demanded which an honest man would blush to give., would rather die than
give.” Also **BAA 197.** Assures Estlin that the testimony of Europeans
and public opinion against slavery is effective. “*Were your influence*
(British, Irish, European influence generally) so small and to such
little purpose, why should the slaveholdg Presses be so anxious to
direct that influence into other channels?”
