relinquish the {u}more doubtful & circuitous mode{/u}’ (as you are
pleased to call it) of aiding us by your word, and pen, and antislavery
labor at home. You may rely upon it, that it is {u}no doubtful mode{/u}
of helping us. We feel and witness {u}the value{/u} of the sympathy &
co-operation of our English, Scotch & Irish friends, continually …”
