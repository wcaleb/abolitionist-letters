May Jr. to Estlin; Boston {Bulk in {u}BAA{/u}}

BAA: He is enthusiastic about the Antislavery League. He is also glad
Garrison was in England to embarrass proslavery reverends in the
Evangelical Alliance. After first ellipsis: “ … Douglass. I am very glad
that, upon acquaintance, you found that his powers (I now speak of
Douglass) had not been overrated by his friends and fellow-laborers in
the Anti-Slavery Cause. … It is {u}one of my greatest pleasures{/u} to
receive a letter from my Bristol correspondents, and yours are usually
so full and particular, and in every other respect so full of interest
to me, that I should account their discontinuance a real privation and
calamity. …” Tells about the fugitive slave case in Boston. Talks about
the Faneuil Hall meeting on it, which he sees as a good sign. Wonders
what Estlin thought of Burritt. “He is an indefatigable worker, but apt
to be led away by visionary aims, I think, and hardly enough emancipated
from the ‘fear of the folk.’”
