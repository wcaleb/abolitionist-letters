Estlin to May Jr.

Relates story about Douglass’s last speech in England and how
enthusiastic the crowd was. “I have watched F. D.’s course ever since he
has been in England, & consider it a most creditable one to him. He
might have made a good deal of money, & not dishonorably, had he paid
much attention to pecuniary matters. But he has I believe entirely
trusted to the liberality & magnanimity of his friends … The numbers
friends he has made are most enthusiastic in their regard for him. … My
friend R. D. Webb & Douglass did not accord well. I doubt if either
could enter thoroughly into the mind of the other. R. D. W. is a
warm-hearted, sensitive Irishman, more {u}stable{/u} I think than his
countrymen generally are, but more outspoken & perhaps impetuous than is
common to the {u}sect{/u} among whom he was brought up, {u}Quakers{/u}.
Of Douglass I must say that increased observation has tended only to
raise my estimate of his heart & moral sentiments, as well as of his
gifted understanding. [p] I cannot but think he will have some trial to
go thro’ on his return, & I should be curious to know what affect his
visit to England, & his {u}return to America{/u} will have on his
character? No foreign Prince visiting this country feted & courted as
these persons are in the high circles of England, would meet with a
tenth part of the {u}petting{/u} & really {u}affectionate{/u} attentions
that have been lavished upon Douglass. I have been particularly struck
with the propriety of his manner especially towards younger, (I would
rather say {u}unmarried{/u}) ladies, some of whom, I think, have not on
every occasion restrained their favorable opinion within the bounds of
ordinary esteem & regard. If Douglass goes back not a little spoiled, he
will possess one more excellence in addition to those for which I give
him credit.”
