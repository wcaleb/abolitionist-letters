May Jr. to Estlin

Describes how he came to strike up correspondence with Estlin, through
his correspondence with Armstrong and Carpenter. Wilmot Proviso etc.
{Bulk in {u}BAA{/u}: His sympathies in the Mexican War are “all with the
people.” He doesn’t desire bloodshed on either side, but would “rejoice”
in the defeat of “despotic” American invasion.}. Is glad that Douglass
won Estlin’s esteem.
