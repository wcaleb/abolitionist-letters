May Jr. to Estlin

Refers to Garrison’s and Douglass’s meetings on their Western tour as
“{u}monster{/u} meetings.” He thinks Holinski, who is going to Paris,
will be a help to the cause. He is “well-informed” and has “been known,
considerably, to our N. Y. Antislavery friends” and told May he intends
“to take some pains to correct the ignorance & errors of the French
about Amer. Slavery.” Chastises Estlin for some position he has taken on
Unitarian matters.
