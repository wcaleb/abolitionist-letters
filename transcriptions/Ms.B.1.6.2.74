May Jr. to Dr. John Bishop Estlin; [Boston]. “We may see yet in this
country, a change as sudden & as great taking place, as that which has
now overspread Europe.” Mentions the Chartist disturbance. {Some in
{u}BAA{/u}.}

[Doubts that the free-produce movement is the best use of antislavery
energies:] “to urge this, as a principal weapon of offence, would be
very like bailing out the Atlantic with a spoon ...”

“An affair has recently occurred in the District of Columbia, which you
will of course see fully noticed in the Antislavery papers, and
doubtless will see commented upon otherwise. It has agitated the whole
country – it ought to have {u}convulsed{/u} the Northern Section of it –
it is in itself Cause of Revolution, stronger than even the most
oppressed European Nation has had. Just after the tidings of the
successful up-rising of the French people had reached Washington, and a
public meeting had been held there congratulatory to the French Nation
on their achievement of their liberty, a large company of slaves,
residents of {u}Washington{/u}, (nearly 80 in number) endeavored to
effect their escape to a Free State, by taking passage at night on board
a small vessel, the Captain of which had agreed to transport 20 of them
across the Chesapeake Bay to a spot where preparation was to be made to
help their flight. Instead of 20 (as many as his small vessel could well
accommodate,) the Captain found {u}80{/u} on board his vessel, and made
sail lest more should crowd in. The departure of so large a number
caused a special inquiry to be instituted, & suspicion falling upon this
said vessel, she was pursued by Steamers, overtaken, & compelled to
return to Washington. Then was seen, at the Nation’s capital, the sight
of a band of 80 men & women marched to the {u}National{/u} Jail, for no
other crime than the attempt to secure for themselves that freedom,
whose praises had been so loudly said or sung in their ears, when
Frenchmen were in question – so marched, together with the Captain &
crew of the vessel, followed by a howling mob, from whose fury it was
with the greatest difficulty only that Capt. Sayres was saved alive! ...
All this is done openly, & {u}approved by State and Church{/u}, -- I
speak the truth, I lie not – openly I say in the City of Washington,
Congress in Session, &c. &c. I do not undertake to put on paper what I
think of this {u}professed{/u} Christian Republic ... I can command no
language which comes near to expressing my sense of this national
outrage! ... This matter has not shaken the country to its foundations,
as ought to have been the case, and would have been if truth & honor
prevailed amongst us: -- still it has produced a great sensation, beyond
I think almost any previous outrage of the infernal system which we
cherish in our Constitution, & among our institutions. [Antislavery men
like Hale and Giddings have spoken out in Congress, and Calhoun and the
Southern Congressmen are on the defensive.] ... GOD {u}does{/u} uphold
the right – why should we ever doubt it, or allow ourselves to be
impatient! We may see yet, in this country, a change as sudden & as
great taking place, as that which has now overspread Europe. ...
[Excerpt from {u}BAA{/u}: Glad that violent clashes were avoided in
England.] ... From a recent Speech of W. Phillips’s (at the Quar.
Meetg., Worcester) I will give you an extract or two, which I happened
to note down at the time – ‘The Slave is at {u}war{/u} with this Nation
& with every man in it; and where is the Law of Nations that has not
always recognised the right of parties to take and use for their own
benefit the {u}property{/u} of those with whom they are at war?’ ‘The
Slave has the same right to take a horse, or whatever is necessary to
ensure his escape, that a drowning man has to seize a plank or the side
of your boat.’ ... ‘I would instigate the Slave at any time to do that
which is {u}right{/u}, and surely running away is not wrong.’”
