Estlin to May; Bristol. Events in France have strengthened English
adherence to the monarchical form of government. Says Irish discontent
is exaggerated. Quotes Webb as disapproving a separation of England and
Ireland. {Bulk in {u}BAA{/u}.}

[Prior to the {u}BAA{/u} extract, he mentions that 20 copies of a French
translation of FD’s Narrative have been sent to him by a Miss Parker.]
... [Mentions reading Evangeline, which he didn’t much like, and also
comments that “I can seldom get on with the poetry in the ‘Liberator.’”]
... [Believes Hale and the National Era should be acknowledged for the
good they are doing and the risks they are running, even if they aren’t
up to old org standards.] ... How lamentable is the state of things in
France; nothing is yet done towards a fixed Government. Commencing as
the Prov Govt did with such a step as giving money to workmen without
any regard to their labour in return, what but mischief could ensue! It
will be well if the revolution do not terminate in some sort of
despotism. I can easily conceive the duty of sympathizing with the
French on obtaining their emancipation; rather a bitter pill to some of
your Southern Aristocrats! How long {u}we{/u} shall entirely escape the
[?] of Continental violence I know not. The condition of Ireland is
serious, -- & hopeless as far as any remedy is obvious – But I find I
have touched on these topics in the former part of my letter begun a
fortnight ago.” BAA: Hypocrisy of American expressions of sympathy with
French republicans.
