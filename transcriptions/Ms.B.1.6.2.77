**[1848, 07-16] Ms.B.1.6.2.77**

May to Estlin; Leicester. Long letter. Discusses Free Soilers, Liberty
Party, Hale, Unitarian Reply, father-in-law’s apparent suicide, etc.
Also informs Estlin that Chapman is taking her children to Paris.

“... A gross foreign postage tax is now inflicted upon us. No letter can
be sent from, or received in, this country, to or from Gr. Britain
without a tax of 24 cents ... {u}in addition{/u} to what must also be
paid in your country! This is by way of retaliation upon your government
for assessing a like tax upon letters transported by the {u}American
steamers{/u}. It was a very unjust act on the part of the Br. Post
Office (or Govt.) to begin with, and a very foolish one, on the part of
{u}our{/u} Govt. to retaliate. Between the two, the people are annoyed
and fleeced. If we would prepay a letter (of 1/2 an ounce) to a British
friend, we must pay 58 cts. through [Hamden’s?] office, or 29 pence. – I
think this can’t last long.”
