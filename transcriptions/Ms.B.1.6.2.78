Estlin to May Jr.; Bristol.

“We are sorry to miss Mrs Chapman. We went to Paris almost immedy after
her arrival in England. {u}France{/u}, in its present state, seems an
odd place to take children to for education! How deplorable, & (as far
as the eye can reach) {u}hopeless{/u}, is the present condition of that
ill fated country! Its Liberty, Equality & Fraternity are much the same
as American inalienable right of Freedom!” [sic] ... “This morning’s
post has also brought me a litter from our [scribbler?] friend R.D. Webb
on the condition of Ireland, respecting which the ignorance of your
countrymen, (if at least I may judge from the most popular papers I am
quoted,) is really {u}amusing{/u}.”
