Estlin to May Jr.. Says it is difficult for the English to help the
Irish so long as the Irish won’t help themselves. Belittles the Chartist
disturbances. Condemns the activities of the French politicians.
Mentions the Abos’ reputation for intolerance. {Bulk {u}BAA{/u}.}

“ ... Mr. Quincy’s notice of Ireland in the Liberators of August 25 &
[Sept 1?] are good, & fair. The ignorance in which the Catholic Priests
keep the Irish, & the utter indifference to truth which they encourage,
are I believe some of the greatest obstacles to the removal of the
evils. ... I wish in all philanthropic movements, (the U.S. not
excepted) that the sentiment was more general – {u}if the good is done,
never mind who does it{/u}. ... You must not attach too much importance
to Mr. Ashurst’s letters: his views are very {u}ultra{/u}, & very far
from being the type of opinions of even the class to which he belongs.
He may represent the opinions of a section, but a small, & uninfluential
one in this country, of reformers of {u}all{/u} evils moral, political,
social &c. but they do not in general carry with them the sympathy of
many, quite as liberal, but with more judgment & more refinement, & it
is curious to see the great jealousy existing among all grades of the
reformers of our social habits, of the class that happens to be next
{u}above{/u} them. I have heard that Mr. Ashurst’s daughters, to show
their superiority to the [?] conventionalities of society, have been
seen in a cab, {u}smoking segars{/u}! [sic]. All these matters I wish
not to go beyond yourself.
