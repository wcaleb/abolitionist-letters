Estlin to May Jr.; Bristol. Discusses a meeting of “Western Christian
Union” in Exeter.

“I was {u}compelled{/u} to speak to the sentiment of ‘Christian
Philanthropy,’ & dwelt espec^y^ upon Am^n^ {u}Slavery{/u}; telling the
company, (8 or 10 ministers among them) that some of the most eminent of
our ministers had not paid the subject the attention it deserved. – that
they were behind their flocks: I particularly noticed Jas. Martineau’s
opinion that Slaveholding was not an ‘{u}individual sin{/u},’ – that it
was the ‘{u}misfortune{/u} of the individual the {u}crime{/u} of the
State.’ I said that many an uneducated, simple minded layman could
enlighten his understanding, & I hope, could warm his heart, on this
subject, & asked if the Slaveholders could wish a better ally?”
