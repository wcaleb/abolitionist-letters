May Jr. to Carpenter

Discusses a “council of reformers” called yesterday by Theodore Parker,
with names present: Emerson, Amos Alcott, William H. Channing,, James F.
Clarke, WLG, Wendell Phillips, Mrs. Follen, James and Lucretia Mott,
Caleb Stetson, John L. Russell, Francis Jackson, Charles Sumner, Samuel
G. Howe, E. H. Chapin, Elizur Wright Jr., etc. … “the object was to
discuss the general principles of Reform, and the best means of
promoting it. … It was a matter of deep interest even to {u}see{/u} this
collection of the {u}men alive{/u} of our neighborhood and day. From 4
to 10 p.m., with a short interval for tea, a most spirited conversation
was held on all the great Reform subjects of the day. I am more than
ever convinced that the Anti Slavery Reform carries all others with it,
and that its triumph will be theirs.”
