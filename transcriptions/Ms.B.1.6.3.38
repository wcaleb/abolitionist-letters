Haughton to May Jr.; Dublin {Some in {u}BAA{/u}.}

“… I now stand in a position in which I am not likely to be able to make
much stir as a public man, as I have differed with & dissented from both
our political parties, Old & Young Ireland, & I hold no principles in
unison with our Conservatives, who are, I apprehend, analogous to your
Whigs. … Farewell, dear friend. Civilization has certainly done
something for us, seeing that it enables you & me to talk to one another
across some three thousands of miles. By & by we may have an Electric
Telegraph as a medium of communication, &, in the long run Earth may be
changed into Heaven.”
