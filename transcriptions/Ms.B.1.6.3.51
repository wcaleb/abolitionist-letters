May Jr. to Mary Carpenter. [Boston] Discusses the Chartists: See BAA.
Says that there are Americans who will support any movement which seems
likely to embarrass the British government. Hopes that the British will
do more than crush the Irish Rebellion i.e. will remove its causes as
far as possible.

“I thank you for the various publications which you sent me. ‘Politics
for the People’ I should judge (from a very cursory perusal of it, as
yet) would prove a highly useful work. Very plain & direct & homely even
in its style, it seems to be controlled by high principle, and to
possess a sincere sympathy with the people’s cause without running into
any sanction of violent outbreaks on their part. ... You speak of the
Chartists, and of the sympathy which, you suppose, is generally felt for
them in this country. It is true that much sympathy is felt here in
their cause, or rather in the objects for which they are contending; but
there is, I think, but little sympathy for their violent plans for
accomplishing those objects. So far as I understand the objects of the
Chartists, I think them just, equal, what is due to them as men, & what
is absolutely needful to elevate them to a social position where they
will learn to respect themselves, & so become worthy of the respect of
others. There is a class in this country, not very numerous, I suspect,
but rather noisy & quite persevering, who will oppose & aid any movement
got up by anybody whatever, which looks likely to embarrass the British
government, and cripple British power. The defeat of the Irish
revolutionary schemes was a terrible extinguisher upon the hopes & plans
of these men – it really ‘put them out’ entirely! Scarce a word has been
uttered by them for many weeks; and there is no encouragement, clearly,
for them to be very talkative. But I hope England is not going to be
content with {u}crushing Irish rebellion{/u}. Irish misery ought to be
well considered, relieved, & measurably prevented. You have a
{u}strong{/u} Government, as is plain from its triumphant success in
several most critical seasons, and in a year when nearly every other
European throne fell, or at least was {u}shaken awfully{/u}. If so
strong to suppress violence, to disperse & scatter legions of
disaffected men, it must have strength to benefit them, and to open a
way for their ultimate rescue and relief. [Refers to Parker’s Letter on
American Slavery, and his recently published ‘Sermon of the Mexican
War,’ which has been warmly commended but which May has not yet had time
to read.]
