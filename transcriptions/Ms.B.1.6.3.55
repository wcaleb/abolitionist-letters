Weston, Caroline, to May Jr.; Paris. Expresses great admiration for
Paris. ... Talks about the French political situation.

“One should be able to write interesting letters from Paris at this
time, but we have little {u}time{/u} to observe even if we knew ‘how to
observe.’ Our time is so entirely occupied by the children’s
preparations for their various masters & {u}I{/u} am so much engaged in
the endeavour to familiarize myself with the language, that the short
days of this dark season are entirely occupied. We are becoming very
well acquainted with Paris – indeed I feel now nearly as much at home
here as in Boston. I am more & more charmed with it as my acquaintance
increases. I now find that I really have not the power of {u}seeing{/u},
on my first arrival & know that my powers of perception have
{u}grown{/u} greatly since by the increased pleasure afforded by all the
splendours around me. ... We are studying Italian also with great vigor,
hoping to visit Italy before our return. I hear to day that the Pope has
taken sanctuary on board of a French steamer & is coming to Paris
indirectly. The Chamber has decided that he comes in his spiritual & not
his temporal character. ... [Paris is] the most delightful place in the
world – so much of beauty, grandeur elegance surround you here.
[Mentions sights – Notre Dame, Louvre, etc.] ... All continue quiet here
still & I find it difficult to believe that there can be any commotions
– Yet all the most intelligent persons whom we see seem to have little
doubt of impending tumults & even civil war. – The danger seems to be in
the election of Louis Bonaparte -- With our limited opportunities of
observation it is difficult for us to form any opinion as to the future
– There can be no doubt that there is a great deal of republicanism here
but whether it forms such a basis as a constitution can safely rest upon
is the question – France is it seems to me like a cauldron which can be
& is made to boil & evaporate by the application of heat [in immediate?
in an instance] moves to the surface, while ice has frozen below. The
higher & privileged classes are discussing great principles, & some of
them that dwell in darkness have seen a great light while the Peasantry
in one class [we met?] when they hear Bonaparte named shout ‘Vive
l’empereur,’ & in another they avow their intention of voting for a
{u}woman{/u} to fill the office of President (this [would?] not be so
bad either) “{u}the{/u} woman who has done so much for France they
wished to name’, on being questioned further, they said “{u}La –
Martine{/u}”!! They wished to vote for her. [Asks to tell the joke to
someone whose name I can’t make out.] ... General [Cavignac’s?] able
defence has had a most interesting effect & has greatly increased his
popularity. The [reasonable?] republicans seem assured that he can
better answer the purpose of the state than any other ...” [Very hard to
read because of cross-writing; be careful about quotes.]

**[1849] SHG Papers, CU**

WP to SHG. “I notice in this week Std. this petty Pennsyl. circular. I
might have spared the first epithet; the second including it. {u}We{/u}
ask no foreign aid to sustain our {u}state{/u} paper, cause, or
organization – but, on the contrary, after doing that, create the market
here which buys the English Goods & so far sustains the {u}National{/u}
Socy. Was it not enough for Pennsyl. to concentrate almost all
{u}her{/u} own funds on her own soil, but must she abstract our
resources for {u}general{/u} purposes? Then the mean insinuations of the
paper, so sectarian, as well as sectional – What welcome you may have
for it I know not, but I do not relish stabs under the fifth rib -- & I
wish you had left the matter to first see the light in the columns of
the P.F. & with no better herald than Cyrus. Even then, under the
circumstances, we could not have made [war?] on it – but we had saved at
least the [?] of the Standard.”

Lamartine, to MWC; Paris. A.N. (3d person), expressing willingness to
receive social visit & thanking her for copy of {u}Liberty Bell{/u}. Not
sure whose writing it is in. Good for an illustration. {Has to be at
least 1849 – that’s when Chapman was in Paris.}

“Mr and Mme. de Lamartine will be happy to receive the visit of Mrs.
Weston Chapman any evening between eight and nine and to thank her for
the interesting volume of the Liberty Bell. Paris. 80 rue de
l’université. Wednesday morning.”
