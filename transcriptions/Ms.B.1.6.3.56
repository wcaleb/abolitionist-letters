Armstrong, George, to May Jr. ... Mentions the need for emancipation in
Cuba and South America.

“I write these few lines – to offer you my congratulations on what
appears to me to augur the period, {u}soon{/u} to arrive, when
{u}Abolitionism{/u} will occupy that culminating point to which you are
labouring to bring it. Once arrived {u}there{/u} its march will be a
{u}Descent{/u} upon the enemy -- & no longer a battle. And {u}then{/u},
I think, you & I may both live to see it come. Am I too sanguine in so
believing, from the recent indications affording in the proceedings of
the H. of Representatives, in which ‘the cause’ has so far advanced as
to have [?] a vote or resolution against the {u}extension{/u} of Slavery
into any New Territory – with the further triumph (so I understand the
matter) of a resolution for the extinction of slavery (or Slave Traffic
– which?) in the District of Columbia? [p] Of course, such slow &
cautious treading as this cannot satisfy the wishes of an abolitionist
mind; -- but as indicating the advancing {u}power{/u} of {u}opinion{/u},
which Abolitionists are doing so much to spread & strengthen, they must
surely be hailed as a most auspicious commencement of a career in the
right path. Yet, in looking at this matter, one hardly knows what to
conjecture – as to the nature of the causes which are to determine the
cessation of Slavery in the Great Western Continent. The U. States would
greatly influence the more southern powers. And there {u}moral{/u}
conjointly with commercial & natural causes – would no doubt operate
considerably. But I think they must work together. Slave labour must be
{u}proved{/u} to be [{u}dear{/u}?] as well as wicked; -- unthrifty &
impolitic as well as unrighteous; -- & then (shall we say only then?) –
it will disappear from those blighted regions! [p] If any thing
{u}moral{/u} could effect a change, I have not met with any recent
contribution so stirring & beautiful as some lines by ‘Martin Farquhar
Tupper’ in the Anti-Slavery Standard of Nov 16 1848. ‘Ye [Thirty?] Noble
Nations.’ What think you of the Cuban question? England has claims on
Spain – but would she interfere -- & have a first security on that
colony? I doubt it. {u}Could{/u} it be {u}kept{/u} in Slavery – if the
‘Cause’ continues to hold its way in the feelings of yr H. of
Representatives? How many questions I could ask you!”
