May Jr. to RDW; Boston.

“We feel confident that the Antislavery movement has got such headway,
that no power on earth can stop it. Hypocrites and cowards, as well as
the unprincipled generally, strive to put every possible obstacle in its
way, and of course contrive to impede it somewhat, but ‘it’s of no use’;
their machinations are now easily seen through, and their paltry objects
detected, by almost every one. ‘Tis no longer the difficult task it once
was, to open the eyes of the people to the pro-slavery frauds practised
upon them. I never felt more assured, than I do now, of the downfall of
Slavery, and that at no very distant day.”
