Lupton, Joseph, to Samuel May, Jr. [Leeds]. Thinks that Father Mathew
went “sadly astray” and should not have come to the U.S.

“... assure you & our other friends engaged in the noble work of
abolition, that you have a {u}few{/u} friends in Leeds, who take a
lively interest in your proceedings, & often think & talk of your
movement. I am very sorry our contribution this year is so small, but
can assure you it is a most difficult thing to keep actively in mind
your cause amongst {u}many{/u} friends, particularly when there are so
many other interests pressing around us, & being of a ‘{u}home{/u}’
character, are felt the more powerfully. There have been ‘Church’
Bazaars held in our town during the past year, which have drawn heavily
on the Ladies’ work & time ... [His brother is currently in the U.S.]
poor Father Mathew appears to have gone sadly astray; my brother says,
it would have been well for his character if he had never touched
American soil.”
