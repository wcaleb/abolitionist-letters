James Haughton to May Jr.; Dublin

Discusses efforts for peace between England and USA; postscript by RDW.
Sends the Irish Unitarian Address. “I have also to thank you for an
occasional Newspaper, which shows me that I am not forgotten by you. I
have reciprocated kindness with you in the same way, & for a similar
purpose, to let you know that your short visit to us lived in our
remembrance. … By the Liberator & Standard, I get regular accounts of
the progress of the Anti slavery agitation among you & through the same
medium you learn a little of our labors in the cause. … It is my
impression that, when {u}you{/u} shake off Slavery, that America will
soon be Liberty’s guiding star over the earth. You are less shackled by
bad habits than we Europeans are, a wider spread of education & a
greater spirit of fearless enquiry dwells among you than with us, so
that fewer impediments on the road of advancement, impede your footsteps
than ours.”
