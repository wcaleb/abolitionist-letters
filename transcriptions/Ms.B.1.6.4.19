Abolitionists are scattered all over “upon the face of the earth,” but
that’s better than having all in one place. “How singularly ‘the
Abolitionists’ are scattered about, up and down, upon the face of the
earth! One or two in this city, one or two in that—here a solitary one,
there a little company, but in no place many of them. This is often a
subject of regret; as year after year rolls by, to think how great the
distance is which separates us from the greater part of those with whom
we sympathize so closely, and to think, too, how little probable it is
that we shall see them ever again on earth, this is & must be painful &
trying. Many inconveniences attend this comparative isolation. But,
then, on the other hand, how many & great advantages. Suppose we all
lived together in one community; that might be very delightful, and
doubtless would be so {u}for a season{/u}. But where would be our
influence on the world? The talent & influence and value of each
individual would become merged, & mostly lost, in the general unity of
thought & feeling around him. It is clearly a very wise Providence—is it
not rather a striking & remarkable fact in that Providence—that the men
& women, called to be Antislavery saints, are thus placed in separate
places, in different sections of the great field widely-scattered, where
each one may find full exercise for all the wit and nerve and power of
endurance in his composition, and so that it shall turn out that no
country, or quarter shall be left without some testimony for the truth
and against the reigning lie. …”
