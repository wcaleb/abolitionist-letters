May Jr. to RDW

Lists subscribers to the Antislavery Advocate—all told 12 names and 22
subscriptions. The usual suspects are here (EQ, May Jr., Whipple, AWW,
Jackson, Phillips, MWC, Buffum) although Lucy Stone also subscribes. “We
are all greatly pleased with the Advocate.” Garrison is pleased with his
article on John Bright and plans to reprint it. John Estlin also liked
it.
