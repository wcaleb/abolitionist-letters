May Jr. to RDW

Comments on Irish Americans. Thanks for the Address sent by the Dublin
Meeting. “We shall try to put this to a good use. Would to GOD the
{u}Irish heart{/u}, in this country, could be turned to a compassionate
feeling for the Slaves. But evil & designing men have worked on their
ignorance & vanity, (representing the {u}nigger{/u} as their inferior,
as of every {u}white{/u} man), and on their poverty & need, representing
him as their rival, in labour,--so that, with here & there an exception,
we get no help from the Irish.”
