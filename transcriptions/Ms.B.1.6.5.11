“By the steamship fr. Europe, last arrived, we received the stirring
news of the active preparations for immediate hostilities making in
England, & especially in France. The chances of escape from a very
extensive, & even a general, war seem now to be very few & very narrow.
War is an enormous evil, & in point of fact rarely accomplishes any good
that might not far better have been gained in other ways. Yet, as a
practical question, it appears very difficult to refrain from active
measures to curb the grasping spirit of Russia;--indeed, as if it would
be wrong in any nation, having the power to resist it, to stand idly by,
& see the triumph of Russian arms & policy. Our people, universally,
feel a very lively interest in this question of War in Europe.”
