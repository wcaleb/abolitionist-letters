RDW to May Jr.

He is astounded by the Nebraska bill. “There is in my opinion something
appalling in the state of public feeling that tolerates this state of
things. We {u}may be{/u} as corrupt here, but the Depravity and
abandonment of principle are amazingly palpable and undisguised in the
United States. The material position of the poorer classes is inferior
with us, but on the whole I think we are in a sounder state here. This
ready alacrity of acquiescence in Chattel Slavery is incomprehensible to
me, in conjunction with so much light & so much liberty. The older I
grow, the more I learn, the more do I loathe the state of mind that
appears to prevail in the United States. It quenches the hopes of
mankind. What can we hope for or look for, when the Free States of the
American Union are so readily drawn into acquiescence with such
stupendous crimes, and are so ready to reward the criminals? … As to the
approaching war with Russia I am entirely of your mind, and as far as I
can see, so are all here except the Peace Party who object to all way on
any account. The grasping, cruel, & selfish aims of Russia are apparent
and if she be not withstood now, the civilization of Europe has nothing
to hope from her forbearance. It is not so much a war to support the
Turks as to drive back the Russians. As a matter of principle the
nonresistants only stand on consistent ground, and to expect any number
of human beings to be nonresistant to all offence & all attack, is to
the last degree absurd.” RE: Joseph Barker, he often gets carried away
by his hobby horses. “His hostility to the British government induced
him to say the most extravagant things both against our
aristocracy—though I have a middling opinion of them myself—and he took
up the part of the Young Irelander in an equally extravagant way . … He
was enthusiastic for Mitchell. The worst thing that could have happened
for Ireland would have been the success of such men. When he thought of
emigrating he saw almost every thing of the brightest in the U.S. and
while he condemned slavery, he contended most untruly that your slavery
and the oppressive results of our old bad laws were identical. We are
constantly improving—you are it seems to me deteriorating away to the
ascendancy of the Slaveholding influence.”
