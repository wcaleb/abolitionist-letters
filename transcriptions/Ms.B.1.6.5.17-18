May Jr. to RDW

Corrects a statement Pillsbury is alleged to have made about the low
circulation of the Standard. Refers to American slavery as a “world-wide
question.” “What you say about the Nebraska question, and about the
state of mind thereby developed, is well said. I do not wonder that you
are lost in amazement, as you look upon this land. We are, here, often
bewildered;--for myself I cannot learn fast enough the lessons this
country affords of the depths to which human nature will descend, in
order to subserve its selfish ends,--to reform from such astonishment
and disgust, as no dictionary at my command is sufficient to give vent
to. Still we have been having some quite hopeful developements [sic] of
Northern feeling, which you will have noticed before receiving this. The
North is more thoroughly aroused than I ever before knew it to be. There
is more of an antagonistic feeling than I ever have known before. The
infamous Bill will be passed, and passed this session I do not doubt.
Blood will be shed, if necessary, to intimidate. But passed, or not
passed, the South and its friends have given us such a specimen of their
duplicity and fraud, as the Northern people will not be likely to
forget.”
