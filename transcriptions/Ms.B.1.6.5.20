Re: Douglass. “I have an abiding faith in the principles and measures of
the Am. A. Slavery Society, and though we may not live to see that
glorious period arrive ‘when slavery is no more,’ let us not despair at
the apostacy [sic] of Frederick Douglass: Judas betrayed his master for
thirty pieces of silver, yet the whole world is redeemed through the
efficacy of his blood! Benedict Arnold betrayed his country for a
similar bribe, yet our revolutionary fathers succeeded in securing
liberty for themselves, though unrighteously withheld from 3,500,000 of
our brethren. … But after all I think we can afford to lose a few
deserters, deserters are spy’s [sic] and traitors and by their own acts
are outlaws. …”
