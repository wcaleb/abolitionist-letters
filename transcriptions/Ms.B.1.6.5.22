Steinthal to May Jr.

Joseph Barker ought to “know better than to compare the state of even
the lowest class of the English poor with that of American Slaves. … My
principles lead me to sympathize with the most radical movements, which
can be raised in Europe; I have no love for our Emperors and Kings, and
have been in connection with the so-called friends of Revolution in
Europe. I have no wish to extenuate the wrongs which the people have
suffered, but it is an outrage upon common sense to compare the
condition of an American Negro Slave to that even of a Russian serf.”
