May Jr. to RDW {Some in {u}BAA{/u}}. BAA: “the President has asked for
Ten Millions of Dollars to make war with Spain, for Cuba, if he can
construe a pretext for the same. That there will be no difficulty in
picking a quarrel, we may be very certain. I send you a little slip,
showing that measures are in train for a treaty of amity, or something
of the sort, between the *United States & Russia!* Russia will keep
England & France busy, while the U. States rifle Spain of Cuba. This is
evidently the meaning. In return this slaveholding Govt. will help the
Czar in some way,--perhaps by a loan of money!”
