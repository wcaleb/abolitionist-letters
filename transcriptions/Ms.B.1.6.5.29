Steinthal to May Jr. Remarks on a letter to the *Liberator* which blamed
Parker Pillsbury for not attacking the oppression of the English people
by their government. Says there is little reason for complaint. Compares
English and American ideas of freedom. Says many noblemen favor
Abolition.

“I was rather amused, & perhaps a little annoyed at a letter which I see
in the last Liberator (No 1052) signed ‘one of your subscribers ever
since 1835’ in which our good friend Parker Pillsbury is rather blamed
for his silence about the wickedness of the English government and
people. I think that some of our good friends in America have rather
strange notions about England & English Institutions & fancy that we are
suffering under some sad oppression. Letters like those that Joseph
Barker sends you are perhaps calculated to keep up this delusion, and
yet we that live here do not find such great reason for complaint. My
friends here never gave me credit for much Toryism, I dare say. I am
rather too much of a radical for such a suspicion ever to be raised
against me, & it has never been my habit to speak of our English
Institutions in Church and State as the model of a Constitution. I have
left that to Republicans of the United States pattern. I grant we have
many things that can bear improvement, & I could perhaps reckon up as
many things in the present state of affairs that need that amendment as
the old subscriber could. But there is one great difference in our
English grievances and the one great grievance of the United States. We
have nothing that denies the humanity of any human being that breathes
upon our shores: our State Church never sells its members to send Bibles
to the heathen, as your voluntary Churches do. Our Government although
it has carried on unjust wars enough, never pledges its whole power to
keep in servitude, men born upon our soil, because that have a shade of
darker colour on their skin. We do not give up our prisons, to confine
men whose only crime is that they love liberty. We are sadly below that
perfection which must be the goal of humanity, but the direst wrong
committed under the Sanction of England’s time honoured name, cannot
compare with slaveholding as practiced in the Model (?) Republic. And if
Mr. Pillsbury while visiting us were not to speak of the evils he sees
here, because his mind is absorbed by the one great evil which
transcends all others, I for one cannot see that he is to blame. But let
me say that while Mr Pillsbury was my guest, I heard him speak of things
which the English government had done in anything but laudatory terms. …
Let me say one word too about our Antislavery friends here and their
relation to English wrongs. Of course we being brought up under
monarchical rule, do not look upon that form of government as many of
you Republicans do. We have seen in our past history that many
advantages arise from our constitution, & with reforms in Parliament, in
the civil service, & general patronage, all of which we shall obtain, we
do not hesitate, to say that we are satisfied with our government and
are loyal to our Queen: Some of the prominent Antislavery Men belong to
our Aristocracy. They naturally hold even stronger views than I have
expressed: but it can never be said of men like Lord Shaftesbury, Lord
Brougham and others I can name that they have been indifferent to the
improvement of their fellow countrymen: there is hardly a practical
philanthropic movement with which the name of Ashley has not been
associated, nor an enlightened movement for education which has not been
supported by Lord Brougham. Descending to those who hold a lower rank,
look through the list of English Abolitionists. They are ever to be
found among the active workers in reforms at home. … [English
abolitionists believe] that one of the best means of aiding the Anti
Slavery movement is to take part in these reformatory movements at home,
because we know that public opinion is the great lever by which we can
act upon America, and because we know likewise that the public opinion
of a noble and enlightened nation will be of greater power than that of
a benighted & ignoble people. … it is because our principles are not
bounded by the narrow limits of our own little island, but because we
feel that ‘our Country is the World, & our countrymen are all mankind.’
No true Abolitionist is a friend of oppression, & although he may differ
in opinion as to forms of government and theological doctrines no
American Abolitionist need fear that in England the opponents of
American Slavery are the defenders of wickedness and cruelty.”
