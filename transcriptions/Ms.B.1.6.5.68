Steinthal to May Jr.

Mentions Kossuth; Burns episode.

“Last night brought us the welcome intelligence that the Senate had by
its triumphant majority decided that a kidnapper could not remain an
officer of the state of Mass. Many a heart rejoices with your faithful
band in this victory of Antislavery Sentiment. … It is so novel a
sensation to see a victory gained by the Abolitionists in America, that
we can hardly picture to ourselves the change that must have taken place
… I was rather sorry to see the tone which was adopted by the Standard
in speaking of Kossuth’s remarks on Slavery. You must have noticed that
in several letters to the Times he has spoken with hearty condemnation
of slavery & pointed it out as the cause which prevents the United
States taking the stand they should do among the nations of the world.
If he did act with too great subserviency to the slaveholding oligarchy
whilst on his visit to your country and no one can deny his lamentable
shortcomings then, yet we should all joyfully welcome his amended
conduct, and remember his former feelings only to give us greater joy
over his improved sentiments. … And when we remember that Kossuth has
offered much for liberty, and only for a time obscured his glory, we
should indeed rejoice that the cloud has passed away & he again shines
forth brightly & undimmed. We ought never to forget that it is to the
Hungarian party of which he is the acknowledged leader, that the
Hungarian serfs owe their freedom, that he was the advocate of freedom
long before the revolution of 1848, that he was imprisoned for his love
of liberty, and is now an exile for his fidelity to her sacred cause. It
is not kind to speak of his change as too late. It cannot be too late.
The sinner dying on the cross was pardoned: shall not the living man,
who has still the power of speaking words of fire be welcomed among
those who are lauded together to bring about the reign of freedom and
humanity among the children of men?”
