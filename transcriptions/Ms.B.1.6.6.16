Steinthal to May Jr.; Bridgewater

Trying to find work for Kossuth’s secretary. “There is a friend of mine
in London, who used to be the Foreign Correspondent for the New York
Daily Times, & still is a regular contributor to the Independant [sic],
a Mr L. Czernátony, a Hungarian Gentleman late private Secy to Kossuth
(during the Revolution). He wishes to have a place as correspondent to
some American Journal of liberal principles. If you hear of any such
thing will you bear him in mind. He is dependant upon his pen since the
Revolution, and is a true-hearted man. He finds fault enough with
Kossuth’s American doings.”
