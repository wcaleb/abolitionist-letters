Steinthal to May Jr.

European situation; his views on violence.

“I have been much interested in your Non Resistance discussions in the
Liberator, although I must confess to more practical sympathy with the
Resistants, than the Peace men. To a man who accepts the plenary
inspiration of Scripture, I must confess I see no escape from your
doctrines, but to us [words lost in a tear] … I think the argument not
so strong. But we are at peace again. … but I cannot say that I have
great hopes of [the continuance or permanence] of tranquility in Europe.
The state of the Continent is so fundamentally unsettled, there is so
much latent dissatisfaction against all the governments, that an
[opportunity is waiting?] to spread the flame of revolution over the
face of Europe. The Italian Question is as you will have noticed from
the Papers exciting much interest at present in England, owing to the
very outspoken protest of Count Cavour at the Paris conferences and
afterwards in the Chambers of Sardinia, but as far as I can gather, the
Democrats are of the opinion that there is far too much praise of
Napoleonic [word covered up] and of French tendencies altogether in the
tone he has adopted, to augur much enduring good to the cause of
freedom. For my part, I believe he is near upon awakening a [storm in]
Italy, and he will find it easier to excite a revolutionary movement
than to guide or to quell it. France and Austria would, be unable to
help Sardinia or any of the monarchs in keeping down a republican
movement, as in case the revolution breaks out anywhere [and] the other
nations will not hesitate to follow the example and seize the opportune
moment. They have learned one lesson in 1848; the necessity of
simultaneous, if not combined action.”
