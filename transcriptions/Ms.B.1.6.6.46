May Jr. to RDW

Condemns Republican Party tactics, etc. “The Republican party are
pursuing the most foolish and suicidal course possible. Their leaders
are disclaiming any intention {u}or desire{/u} to abolish slavery, or
interfere with it in any of the States where it exists by law. They are
scouting the charge of having any sympathy with the Abolitionists. …
Their talk on this subject is as base and brutal and pro-slavery as that
of the democratic hacks who so long have lied to and cheated the people.
… Charles Sumner and Joshua R. Giddings are probably the only two
Republican members of Congress, who hold their office with no selfish
end, and for the honest and genuine purpose to watch the Slave Power and
foil its designs. Even {u}they{/u} make concessions to the Slaveholders,
and give their immensely powerful aid in supporting that government,
which is the great Engine of the Slave Power for accomplishing all its
ends.”
