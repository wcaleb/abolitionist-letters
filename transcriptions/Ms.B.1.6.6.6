Eliza Wigham to May Jr.; Edinburgh. Discusses the American political
situation. Does not expect much from the Republicans.

“We cannot help hoping that John Brown’s life & the lives of his
companions have not been given in vain, but that all these troubles &
excitements are the preludes to greater determination on the part of the
North to cut off the authors of all those atrocities & insults which are
so frequent in the South, from their intimate fellowship … The news
today is that a Democratic speaker is within three votes of being
elected! It shows that the slave power is determined not to be thwarted,
but that it will not allow anti-slavery politicians [illegible], which
after all is more an indication that the efforts so long in use have
produced some important results than in itself a triumph, for expecting
any great action from the Republicans, that is quite a different matter.
Judging them from their own professions we have not much to hope from
them. We have had F. Douglass amongst us here. He has never said any
thing hostile to the American Anti Slavery Society in his speeches … He
says far too much of the Republicans, & gives quite an unfair impression
of them.”
