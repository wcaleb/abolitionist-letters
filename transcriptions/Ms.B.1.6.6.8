Pillsbury to May Jr.; Nottingham

Mentions Crimean War and international situation. “Yesterday, the glad
news of {u}Peace{/u} came throbbing over the telegraphic nerves from
Vienna, & such a hurricane of joy as it brings to the nation! And the
first thing people say to me is, would your President write such a
Message now? The people drove the Ministry into the war, because they
believed it a war for human freedom & elevation, but many are not
satisfied, now that the war has closed, leaving all the nationalities as
they were—and with European despotism more firmly established than
before. And should they now turn their eyes towards England, our valiant
President might have counter orders from his Southern overseers.”
