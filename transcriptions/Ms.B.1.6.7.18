May Jr. to RDW

Refers to the “abandonment of the Bazaar” and its effect on
correspondence. Previously the bazaar had acted like a “{u}magnetic
cable{/u}” so its end probably has “a great deal to do with the
temporary cessation of letters.” He is distressed by the end of the
bazaar because “it takes away a tangible & visible bond of unity and
fellowship without putting anything in its place.” Discusses Right of
Search controversy. Bulk of rest in {u}BAA{/u}.
