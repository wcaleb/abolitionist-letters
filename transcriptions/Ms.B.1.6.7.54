Comments on European situation.

“Yes, I {u}do{/u} hope the French will drive the Austrians out of Italy,
{u}provided{/u} that, then, they take themselves out.—not otherwise. I
have no wish to see Austrian masters exchanged for French, least of all
to see a {u}Buonaparte{/u} authority set up there. But it looks like
that now. I do not believe one word that Louis Napoleon says—but, I
admit, he talks well. Victor Emmanuel & Garibaldi are {u}doing{/u}
well.”
