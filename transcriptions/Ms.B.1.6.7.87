Lydia Maria Child to [MWC?]. No evidence of addressee in the letter.

Tried sending a letter to Queen Victoria by sending it to the British
ambassador, who was not encouraging about its delivery. “It occurred to
me that perhaps you might put it on the way, through Harriet Martineau,
or thro your cousin who is Maid of Honor to the Queen. … If you know how
to direct to Victor Hugo, and Kossuth, please inform me when you happen
to be writing again.”
