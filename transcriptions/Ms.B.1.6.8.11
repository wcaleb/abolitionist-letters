May Jr. to RDW; Boston. The writer criticizes Redpath’s {u}Life of John
Brown{/u} for portraying Brown above all as a “fighting” man. Sends a
copy of William Henry Seward’s Feb 29^th^ speech. Also a copy of a
criticism of same.

“I caused a copy of Mr. Seward’s late speech to be sent to you by the
last Steamer. I hope you will have time to give it a thorough reading,
and favor us with your judgments of it. It was undoubtedly prepared with
express reference to what the Republican leaders believe to be the needs
& policy of the party at this crisis.” Then encloses for the Advocate
some remarks on the speech, which May criticizes for being cold and
lacking moral sympathy with the slave and the abolitionist movement. “Oh
, what sad developements [sic] of character, what lamentable looseness
of moral principle, does a life of politics, and especially it would
seem American Politics, produce! He calls our National preference for
the Union over Freedom a {u}virtuous{/u} preference, our excuse for
yielding so much to Slavery, ‘a virtuous excuse’. He speaks flatteringly
and coaxingly in the ears of the Slave Power; ‘I am no assailant of
States,’ he says. ‘All of the States are parcels of {u}my own
country{/u} … the State least developed and perfected (!) among them
all, {u}is wiser and better{/u} than any foreign State I know.’ This
strikes me as the worst feature of the speech … Mr. Seward deliberately
places such states as Arkansas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia,
Virginia, Texas, in the moral, social, and political scale, {u}above{/u}
any foreign State he knows; States where the {u}education{/u} of the
entire laboring population is absolutely prohibited by law and custom,
under the heaviest penalties, States were no instance of {u}marriage{/u}
exists or is allowed to exist in the case of four millions of working
people, States where no legal protection is ever given to any member of
the working classes against any outrage which his {u}owner{/u} may
inflict, States guilty of a system which is only a synonym for the ‘sum
of all villainies’, {u}above{/u} Scotland, England, Sweden, Germany,
Prussia!”
