Eliza Wigham to May Jr.; Edinburgh. Wants four copies of Redpath’s
{u}Life of John Brown{/u} and one or two copies of Helper’s {u}Impending
Crisis of the South{/u}. They gave their copy of Helper to George
Thompson, who “says he can make many telling lectures from it. He has
given us two lectures in Edin[burg]h, very beautiful & full of
information in themselves. … We are very hopeful that good may result
from the information G. T. has been able to give.”
