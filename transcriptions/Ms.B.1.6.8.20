May Jr. to RDW; Boston. The writer discusses the speeches of George
Thompson, William Henry Seward, and Frederick Douglass. Says the Boston
Anti-Slavery Office does not have a complete file of the {u}A-S
Standard{/u}. *{u}Is sending a large box of books and pamphlets to be
distributed in various places in England, the idea being to form the
nuclei of A-S libraries.{/u}* Asks Mr. Webb for advice as to where to
locate the libraries. Gives a tentative list. Discusses the problem of
starting his son out in life. Has not heard from him in a long time.
Garrison may go to England. Expects the Democrats to elect Stephen A.
Douglas. Says he has tried to curb HCW’s anti-religious comments. Wright
is “quite a trial” to May.

“Yesterday I rec’d, thro Mrs. Chapman, the paper you sent me … and your
note of March 30, a pleasant little episode of your company, seeming as
fresh and natural as if you had run in to the office, ({u}walked{/u} I
should have said,) and sat down for a little talk with us. Garrison was
by, & we enjoyed it together.” If Garrison goes to England he will be
able to counteract “the snake-like and deceptive course of Fred.
Douglass.”
