May Jr. to RDW

Describes failure of Democrats to make a nomination in Charleston,
thanks to fact that “{u}some{/u} few of the Northern Democrats showed
more back-bone, and more boldness in resisting Southern dictation, than
they ever had.” The convention is “in every way remarkable &
instructive; as an historical fact, showing the progress and strength of
the Northern anti-slavery feeling, exceedingly important. … Depend upon
it, ‘in the ears of the oppressors there is a terrible sound’—the noise
of many waters, gathering strength as they come on, and certain in their
irresistible might to sweep away the abomination. Are you as despondent
as you were! Do you not discern some proof of the action of A. S. ideas
on the national mind?”
