May Jr. to RDW. Discusses secession. Criticizes slowness of federal
government to react to South Carolina’s seizure of forts. “ … the United
States government [is] not only defied, but actually driven back and
humiliated before the world by that arrogant, and beggarly State. Such
is our position; rendered all the worse by the fact that all about us &
amongst us” there are Southern sympathizers who want to concede “so
buying peace, trade, and Union, by the sale and loss of character,
honour, principle, freedom, and by falsehood to all the great objects
and ends to which, as a Nation, we are pledged by our Revolution and
Declaration of Independence.”
