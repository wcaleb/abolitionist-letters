May Jr. to RDW; Boston {Relevant section in {u}BAA{/u}.}

Preparations for war; united North. 2pp.

“*Never before* has the North been so united! In one purpose to punish
the South soundly and thoroughly … the North may be said to be
*absolutely unanimous.* What a wonderful change! There is *a North* at
last, and the Southern people are absolutely confounded at the sight. It
is in a large measure the result of the antislavery Education it has
led. … The Administration have not only been abundantly sustained by the
Northern people, but are urged on by them to vigorous & decided
measures. We trust that the overruling Power will now accomplish the
Deliverance of the Slave.”
