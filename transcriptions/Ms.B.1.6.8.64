Eliza Wigham to May Jr.

Thanks for books. Warns against compromise with slavery. Says the North
is not adhering to true Abolition principles.

“ … as yet there is no right anti slavery feeling in the North as a
mass. I think dear Garrison’s prophetic spirit has led him to believe
that what he sees {u}will{/u} come out of the present excitement {u}has
already{/u} come & he attributes more virtue & principle to the rising
in the North than it merits.” Considering the slaves contrabands
degrades them
