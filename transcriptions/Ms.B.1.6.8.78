May Jr. to RDW {Bulk in {u}BAA{/u}.}

Discusses British opinion on the War. He doesn’t doubt that most of the
leading abolitionists are standing firm on the War, but the antislavery
masses have their opinions almost by default, and it’s not a vital
opinion for them. He cites Webb’s own long-standing descriptions of the
English as his evidence. Criticizes daily journals in Britain for
speaking “cloldy, derisively, or adversely of our Government’s war
against the slaveholding Rebellion.”
