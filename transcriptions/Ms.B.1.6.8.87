May Jr. to RDW.

Says that there are obvious signs of “the Nation’s progress towards a
high and just antislavery position. In recent letters, ~~to yourself and
to Mary Estlin~~, I have expressed at some length my settled convictions
upon the aspects of our public affairs. I ought not to wonder, if my
words do seem to you as ‘idle tales.’ But I can only aver that never,
since I became an Abolitionist, have I seen such hopeful times as these
for the Anti Slavery cause—never, when the fields were so white to the
harvest,--never a time when the minds & hearts of the people were so
receptive of light touching Slavery, its character, nature, & fruits.
The War has not turned us all crazy; on the contrary, I think, the first
effects of our new situation having passed away, we have got to look
upon the whole matter with as much soberness and coolness as is the case
with nations more accustomed to the business of war. Nor are we,
Abolitionist, in any way blinded by extravagant expectations of what the
Government is going to accomplish. And yet we are solemnly sure that the
Right Arm of Slavery is broken,--that it never can regain its old
position of influence … and the purpose to {u}crush it{/u} daily gains
strength throughout the North, and has taken deep hold of the
Government. {u}These things being so{/u}, the marked and admitted
tendency being strongly that way, why should we not feel hopeful,
encouraged, and full of faith that the seed sown with labour & tears,
amidst apparent unbelief and hostility, is now about to spring up &
yield its fruit.” Discusses dismay of abolitionists over British
opinion, progress of Northern armies, etc.
