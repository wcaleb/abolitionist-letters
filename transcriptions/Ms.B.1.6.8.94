May Jr. to RDW. 16pp.

Long letter on War and abolitionists’ position. {Bulk in {u}BAA{/u}.}
Especially about the Mason and Slidell incident—he thinks US was in the
right. Criticizes British actions. “*As between your Nation & ours*,
this is not a question whether the U.S. Government is or should be
pro-slavery or anti-slavery. I freely admit, *as an Abolitionist*, the
shortsightedness, the weakness, the folly, of the policy of our
Government. But neither England nor any other nation has a right to make
any condition for us of this sort. To speak plainly, *it is none of
their business* whether, as a Government, we are anti-slavery or not. …
Will England observe her treaty obligations, or not? That is the
question.” All about neutrality.
