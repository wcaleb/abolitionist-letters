May Jr. to RDW.

English attitudes towards the South, speech of John Bright, etc.

Sees encouraging signs that English antislavery feeling is “stirring.”
“I hope we may yet hear the unmistakeable voice of {u}the English
people{/u}, the genuine roar of the British lion, (so long asleep,) at
the infernal, blasphemous attempt, in the middle of the 19th Century, to
build up a Slave Empire, & get England’s friendship & alliance.” Even if
the North’s policy has been uncertain, “there could be no mistake as to
what {u}the South{/u} was about, & what she meant to do, nor that her
purpose was to build up her new Confederacy upon Human Slavery.” He
praises what Bright, Professor Newman, Cairnes & Mill have said against
the English government; they are ably proving May’s own points.
