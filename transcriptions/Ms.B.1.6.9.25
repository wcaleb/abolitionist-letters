Wigham to May Jr.

Garrison on Lincoln, etc.

His recent letters help explain abolitionist position and are not as
harsh as the *Standard* articles she criticized. “I don’t think even
dear Garrison’ explanations are so good as thine, or perhaps thou wilt
say he does not meet our state of mind. & I think he aims more to clear
the administration & to prove that the secession is a rebellion than to
illustrate his own position. We think you have gone a little too far in
defence of the North, but we shall rejoice if now the North comes
forward decidedly through its administration to carry emancipation.” She
regrets that Oliver Johnson apparently excluded a letter from Harriet
Martineau, “your valued & faithful English correspondent,” from the NASS
because it didn’t exactly suit the times.
