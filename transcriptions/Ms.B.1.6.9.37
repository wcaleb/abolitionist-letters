May Jr. to RDW; Leicester

New England Convention; Pillsbury’s criticisms; Barbary emancipation

Talks about divisions caused by Pillsbury faction. However emancipation
comes, “it will really be the result of the Great Anti Slavery Education
which, under the influence & guidance of the Anti Slavery Societies,
this Nation has received during the Thirty Years past. We need not
expect,--no sensible man will, or can, expect,--that a Political
Government will ever decree a great measure like this on the simple
basis of Right and Justice;--‘ever’, I said,--but I should rather have
said, at present, or in our day. I hope, {u}and I believe{/u}, nations
will yet rise to that plane of honesty and self-respect. (Indeed, we
have had {u}an approach{/u} to that higher grade, when one of the
Barbary States, ‘for the honor of God, & to distinguish man from the
brute creation,’ decreed the abolition of slavery. There was, however, I
suspect, some little hypocrisy on the part of the Bey (of Tunis I
believe it was), and a good deal of the credit of the thing, I suppose,
belonged to the English representative then residing in that country.) …
Our Nation owes the slaves of this country, 1. {u}Their freedom{/u} (and
if they won’t give it as their right, let them yield it as a necessity)
2. Education, and Opportunity to rise, as men. And only
{u}generations{/u} of patient and forbearing instruction & guidance can
atone for their long wrongs.”
