May Jr. to RDW 12pp.

Believes that the valor of the slave population is proving their fitness
for a part in the country. Is concerned about “traitors” in the North.
“We must each do his best, watch for the traitors, & then leave the
result with Providence. This is surely a Struggle for Humanity. Let no
true lover of God or Man be idle, or absent from duty now. Chastises the
intimation that Americans have always been hostile to England. “It now
appears, from thousands of unmistakable indications, that the hostile
feeling & the jealousy were the other way; that {u}it is England{/u}
which has long cherished animosity to us, grudged our growth &
prosperity, was jealous of our increasing strength, looked with an
unconcealed satisfaction on {u}any{/u} movement here which promised to
pull us down, and was ready {u}to help & foster Human Slavery{/u} (!) to
help herself and cripple us.” {other sections in {u}BAA{/u}, though I
didn’t myself see the sections in BAA in the letter; the 1st sheet has
been removed from the volume.} The BAA letter goes on to explain that
the division in English public opinion maps onto a division between “her
solid, educated, thinking people” who see the Principle involved in the
War and”her aristocratic & her moneyed classes, with those who usually
hold the reins of Government,” who are looking for any opportunity to
destroy the American republic and are motivated only by selfishness. “If
Prof. Cairnes, and J. Stuart Mill, and John Bright, & the Daily News & a
few other journals are regarded, all will be right.”
