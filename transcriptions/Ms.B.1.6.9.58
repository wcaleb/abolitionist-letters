May Jr. to RDW (Relevant passage in {u}BAA{/u})

The reason why Americans have been so much more upset by English
vacillation than French is that “we have felt that *England* was our
kindred, of the same family—stock, brothers, (or ‘cousins’ at
least;)—and that—having a common language & literature & faith—a common
origin and a closer connexion than between nations generally, we had a
right to look, nationally, for more consideration at her hands than from
others.”
