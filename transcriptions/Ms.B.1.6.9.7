Re: American position on slavery, etc. 10pp.

After first paragraph in {u}BAA{/u} and a few more lines. … “Thus far we
see eye to eye, do we not? I always {u}wish{/u} to see with you, because
we love & honour you so much & have known you so long unswerving from
the straight path of uncompromising anti-slavery & now that we do not
see exactly alike on some things, is that we perhaps each look only on
our side of the shield. My idea is that you abolitionists look more
fixedly on yours than we (abolitionists here) do on ours. I do not feel
so intensely British but that I can look round the corner, & so I think
can R. D. Webb, & on a little of your side too. The greatest hindrance
we have from seeing clearly is the newspaper press of both countries,”
which tries to stir up animosities and breaches between the countries
“It is annoying to see the Standard adopt this common newspaper failing
& write such a fierce article as the leader in Jan 4th. We are anxious
to have breaches healed & these bitter words come from time to time to
prevent our wishes being accomplished.” Reiterates that if the North
will make emancipation its policy, British sympathy will follow.
