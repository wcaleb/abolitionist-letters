May Jr. to RDW

Is amazed to hear that “even Mary Carpenter sides with the
Secession-rebellion, and Rev. Edwin Chapman is about the same! That
{u}does{/u} amaze me. How strange that when we are approaching, drawing
near, the time of complete emancipation, at which we have been told all
England would rise up to commend & befriend us, just there & then the
antislavery sympathy of old friends in England cools off and dies, and
{u}presto, change{/u} starts up on the side of the rebels! … Well, we
live to see strange things. But, on the other hand, how gloriously have
Newman, Bright, Cairnes, Noel, Hall, Mill, &c. &c stood forth.”
