May Jr. to RDW {Some in {u}BAA{/u}.}

Defends himself against the charge of being too nationalistic.

“War is a bad, wretched business anyway—and never to be chosen, if it
can be honestly, decently, honourably, righteously avoided. {u}We{/u}
think we could not have avoided this war without disgrace of the most
lasting & irretrievable description. The issue of eternal slavery, our
own included, was offered to us. {u}What ought we to have done?{/u} What
could we do but join the issue? You speak of me as ‘so intensely
national,’ and thereby give an added proof that (as I see myself) you do
not understand me aright, or see our national struggle in its true
light. It is on {u}far{/u} higher ground than ‘nationality,’ or anything
of the sort that I uphold my country now, & that I condemn the
‘pro-slavery England’ which R. Purvis spoke of last week at the New York
Meeting. [sic] I look, speak, & act from the old Antislavery platform, &
from the highest moral position I can climb to. I stand for the
government now, {u}for its antislavery measures & those only{/u}, &
condemn all others. I am interested in its success, only as Freedom
succeeds & Slavery loses,--as the prospects of a just & righteous Union
proper, & those of essential despotism decline.”
