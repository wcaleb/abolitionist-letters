May Jr. to RDW

Reports news of Union victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg. Discusses
the Alexandra case and the “Polish question.” That too is growing
portentous & bringing the clouds of war over Europe” and placing England
in a bad position. “Well, England has so conducted herself for some time
past as to lose credit & respect pretty extensively,--and with a class
of people who had honored her, on no selfish & merely political grounds.
The middling classes of England, led by such men as John Bright and
Cobden, must, if possible, up-root the power of the British Aristocracy,
or England has a dark future before here, as I judge.”
