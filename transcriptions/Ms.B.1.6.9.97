May Jr. to RDW

May does not think *Webb* has lost his antislavery heart. “If you are
not a good, steadfast, & true friend to the Anti Slavery Principle &
Movement, it has none such in the world. Let that suffice. I think you
excused & defended England & the English Govt too far & too long; and
your later letters indicate that you think so too. I am not disputing
the fact of the English common people being sound & right, & I exult in
such noble men as Newman [and others listed] … but when we speak of
{u}England{/u} we mean the attitude of the {u}whole Nation in the
aggregate{/u}, Govt. & people.”
