More tsk-tsk about Garrison’s association with lower class reformers in
England. “The ‘mistake’ I considered Mr Garrison to have made was simply
in failing to make an [illegible] in favour of the American
abolitionists which he was so well able to do, upon {u}that class{/u} of
English society most likely to be useful to his cause. If Mr Thompson
went to America to plead for the Slave, I presume his advocating the
superior excellence of Monarchical government would disincline many to
hear what he had to say about Slavery?”
